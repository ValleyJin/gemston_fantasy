# 23. Maria’s Secret Revealed <br>
<br><br><br>

"You fool. Do you think trembling like that will save your life?" <br>
Leopold I snatched the spear from Esencino and charged at the peasant militia. <br>

With the power of the GemSTONE, the halberd spun like a windmill, <br>
severing the heads of knights who were assisting Leopold, sending them flying into the air. <br>

But Leopold himself was an exceptional knight, <br>
a ruler hardened by extensive battle experience. <br>

Firing a volley of arrows to carve a temporary escape route, <br>
he hoisted his cousin Esencino onto his horse and attempted a breakthrough. <br>

"We must capture him!" <br>
Gerald fired his longbow, but Leopold swiftly dodged and fled. <br>

From the far end of the Morgarten Gorge, Max spotted Leopold approaching. <br>
However, Max himself was exhausted from prolonged battle and felt uncertain about facing him. <br>

Moreover, the distance from Maria, who could channel the power of the GemSTONE, was significant. <br>
Max had to shatter Leopold’s lance purely with his own strength. <br>

"Can I do this...?" <br>
Max steadied his ragged breath and gripped his halberd firmly with both hands. <br>

Leopold’s white stallion charged straight toward Max. <br>
At that moment, a pair of black horses ridden by Celtic twin warriors rammed into Leopold from the side. <br>

All their horses tumbled to the ground. <br>
Leopold I and Esencino, who had fallen, quickly regained their footing. <br>

Henkel and Aidan, the twin sons of the Celtic priestess, <br>
lifted their fallen black horses and rushed toward the exhausted Max. <br>

"Max! Can you hold on?" <br>
"Thanks for coming. But I’m too tired to face Leopold right now." <br>
"We’re Linkers. We’ll bring the power of the GemSTONE here." <br>

Henkel mounted his horse and raised a massive lance embedded with a GemSTONE high into the air. <br>
From afar, Maria channeled the GemSTONE’s light into the lance. <br>

"Much better now." <br>
The GemSTONE embedded in Max’s halberd also began to glow brightly. <br>

Max’s face brightened as he spun his halberd with one hand. <br>
The GemSTONE embedded in his halberd and armor radiated an intense blue light. <br>

*Crack!* <br>

Aidan’s swiftly thrown lance shattered Leopold’s shield. <br>
With Leopold left defenseless, Max lunged in and swung his halberd down. <br>

*Thud.* <br>

"Brother… Ugh…" <br>

The scream came from Esencino. <br>
Leopold had grabbed Esencino by the collar and used him as a shield against the incoming halberd. <br>
Esencino, with the blade embedded in his chest, let out a final cry and collapsed. <br>

As Leopold, Aidan, and Max engaged in fierce combat, the GemSTONE’s flashes illuminated the battlefield. <br>

"You bastards! Are you using magic?" <br>
Leopold demonstrated his exceptional equestrian combat skills, parrying Aidan and Max’s attacks one after another. <br>

"What the hell are these cursed lights?" <br>
Leopold, puzzled yet awed by the power of the GemSTONE, struggled against their overwhelming force. <br>

"It seems Cesar was right. Someone here can harness the power of the GemSTONE." <br>
Finally, Leopold I’s officers arrived and surrounded him. <br>
"But where is Cesar? He was supposed to pass through this gorge ahead of us, yet he’s nowhere to be seen." <br>
Leopold gasped for breath and surveyed the battlefield. <br>

But up on the Morgarten Hill, <br>
Cesar observed the entire scene through a spyglass. <br>

"I just saw a GemSTONE’s flash heading toward Leopold." <br>
With a sinister grin, Cesar adjusted his spyglass again. <br>
"Where did that flash come from? Haha... The old oak forest at the entrance of the gorge." <br>

He quickly mounted his horse and commanded his men. <br>
"Let’s move! I’ve found Maria’s location!" <br>

Unaware of this, Maria remained hidden in the ancient oak forest, <br>
channeling the GemSTONE’s energy. <br>

With both palms stretched out, she positioned the GemSTONE pile between them. <br>
The GemSTONE’s light repeatedly scanned across her palms in a rhythmic motion. <br>

Discarding expired GemSTONEs, <br>
she reached for a new box, preparing to draw more energy when— <br>

"Ah!" <br>
Maria let out a scream. <br>
Her hands were suddenly bound by thick ropes, yanked backward. <br>
It was the work of Cesar’s men, who had swiftly infiltrated the ranks of the peasant militia. <br>
They soon bound Maria’s hands to a cross. <br>

"Haha… So it’s the hands." <br>
Cesar chuckled, bringing his face close to Maria’s. <br>

"Make sure to keep her hands separated at all times!" <br>
Cesar swiftly loaded Maria onto a carriage and left the scene. <br>
With Maria gone, the battlefield changed dramatically. <br>

Without the power of the GemSTONE, the peasant militia suddenly felt drained and lost their morale. <br>
Their spears and swords lost their destructive force, and within moments, they were pushed back. <br>

The Swiss Confederacy’s forces began falling one by one. <br>
Leopold and his men launched a breakthrough and successfully escaped the Morgarten Gorge. <br>

Meanwhile, in the carriage, Cesar glanced at the bound Maria. <br>
"I suspected there was something special about your hands, but I never imagined it was your palms themselves." <br>
"I don’t know what you mean. I was merely praying." <br>
"Enough of that noble nonsense. Haha." <br>

As soon as they exited the Morgarten Gorge, they reached a secluded forest where Cesar’s main forces lay hidden. <br>
His men hurriedly melted wax and took casts of Maria’s hands. <br>

"You’ll suffer divine punishment for this!" <br>
Maria cursed him, but Cesar merely smirked. <br>
"Punishment? One must die to receive divine judgment. And I do not die. Haha." <br>

A memory from childhood flickered in Cesar’s mind. <br>

A beautiful Celtic priestess had taken him in when he was a wandering orphan. <br>
But the other priestesses despised him, labeling him a demon who would bring ruin upon the world. <br>
They had even tried to kill him. <br>

"This child is innocent!" <br>
Though he called her ‘mother,’ the other priestesses treated him like a monster. <br>
"Do you really see a child before you? This boy is a demon!" <br>

One of their swords had mercilessly severed his left arm. <br>

Snapping out of his reverie, Cesar touched his mechanical left arm. <br>
"Now I understand. If my original arm had remained intact… <br>
I too could have controlled all the GemSTONEs like Maria." <br>

Through his spyglass, Cesar watched as Leopold barely managed to escape the gorge. <br>
Meanwhile, his men finished taking wax molds of Maria’s hands and presented them to him. <br>

"Once the casts are complete, burn her hands with a branding iron." <br>
Cesar’s cold command even startled his own men. <br>
Yet he continued watching the battlefield below, as the Swiss militia were slaughtered mercilessly. <br>

"With Maria’s hands destroyed, only we shall hold the power of the GemSTONEs." <br>
Holding the wax molds in his hands, Cesar grinned with satisfaction. <br>

"Ugh…!" <br>
Cesar let out a strangled cry. <br>

Clutching at his chest, he looked down at the long object protruding through it. <br>
An arrow. <br>
The arrowhead bore the crest of the Rothschild family, inscribed with five arrows. <br>
Struggling to turn, he saw Gerald, a hundred paces away, standing atop a boulder. <br>

"I still have about twenty arrows left." <br>
Gerald’s voice rang out like thunder. <br>
"Three per head should be enough." <br>

Riding forward, Gerald loosed three arrows in succession, instantly killing Cesar’s closest officers. <br>
The remaining soldiers fled in terror, leaving Gerald to cut Maria free. <br>

Gerald rummaged through Cesar’s belongings. <br>
"What the hell was this guy?" <br>
He pulled out a scroll bearing a Celtic symbol. <br>

It was filled with a series of prime numbers. <br>
Maria took out the scroll given to her by her mother and compared it. <br>

The numbers were identical. <br>

"These numbers aren’t random—they’re prime numbers." <br>
"Cesar said my hands were the key to using the GemSTONEs." <br>
"What connection do prime numbers have with your hands?" <br>
Maria and Gerald exchanged puzzled glances. <br>

At that moment, the dying Cesar gasped out his final words. <br>

"Leopold… has escaped." <br>
Cesar coughed up blood. <br>

"Leopold… won’t let this humiliation stand…" <br>
"And?" <br>

"Your mother… is in his palace basement." <br>
Maria and Gerald’s eyes widened in shock. <br>
Cesar chuckled darkly before breathing his last. <br>
