December 1, 2031, 8:13 AM (EST) <br>
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), <br>
Greenbelt, Maryland, MD 20771, USA <br>

The morning sunlight seeps warmly through the windows. <br>
Monitors scattered across the room display the trajectory of Lucy, the asteroid explorer, their screens alive with data streams and orbital paths. <br>

Through the vast control center drifts the Beatles' "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds" <br>

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green <br>
Towering over your head <br>
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes <br>
And she's gone <br>
Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br>
Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br>
Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br>

diamonds <br>
diamonds... <br>

The chorus repeats in his dreams. <br>
But Dr. Alan Kennedy, the center director, had no choice but to wake up. <br>

Andrew handed each of them a donut and coffee. <br>
Dr. Kennedy and the operator rubbed their eyes as they ate. <br>

"By the way, how many years until Lucy returns to Earth?"<br>
"It was launched to Jupiter the year you graduated, Andrew, so that would be 2021? Almost 10 years now."<br>
"Why is it flying over there when it needs to return to Earth..."<br>
"Lagrange point L4... we'll be there in half a day. We'll know soon enough."<br>
"That area is full of asteroids, looks like we're about to waste a billion-dollar probe." <br>

The center director, Dr. Peter Kennedy. <br>
The operator who's been tracking Lucy's trajectory for the past three days. <br>
And Andrew, who just brought coffee and donuts. <br>
These three were the only ones in the control center this early morning. <br>

"Expand the predicted path and take a look."<br>
The operator activated the L'LORRI camera mounted on Lucy. <br>
But the expected trajectory shows only empty space, with distant stars twinkling. <br>
Though some large asteroids can be faintly seen far off the path. <br>

Dr. Kennedy spat out the donut he had been chewing and turned on his headset. <br>
"Operator? Is the high-resolution L'LORRI camera active? Widen the field of view (FOV)." <br>
Asteroids larger than several kilometers now fit into a single frame. <br>
"Can you activate L'Ralph as well? Let's look at it with the infrared filter at maximum sensitivity." <br>
After a long wait, the data comes in. <br>
"Okay. Overlay what's coming in now on top of the earlier image." <br>

The data keeps flowing. <br>
The diameter was roughly 1km, <br>
with a thickness of about 10 meters in a thin donut shape. <br>
The temperature was around 30 Kelvin, <br>
which meant there was definitely a subtle heat source inside. <br>

"In other words, it's an artificial structure..." <br>
Kennedy exclaimed as he read through the analysis data. <br>
The operator's curiosity peaked. <br>
"Why didn't we know about this until now, Doctor?" <br>

Dr. Kennedy enters data while testing hypotheses about the object as they occur to him. <br>

Just then, Andrew burst in through the door. <br>
"Dr. Kennedy! The FBI agents are here!" <br>

"What? At this hour?" <br>
Dr. Kennedy's face turned pale. <br>
"They say it's about The Ring." <br>

The operator's fingers froze over the keyboard. <br>
Dr. Kennedy slowly stood up, his expression hardening. <br>
"How many?" <br>
"Four. They're waiting in the lobby." <br>

As Andrew was about to leave with the agents, <br>

"Lucy will arrive at The Ring soon. Activating reverse thrust system." <br>
The operator reported. <br>

Lucy's reverse thrust system activated. <br>
Everyone paused their steps to watch the monitors. <br>

"Oh...? The Ring's center is glowing!!!" <br>
The operator's voice grew urgent. <br>

The Ring, with its hollow center, <br>
began forming scattered red flames at its focal point, <br>
which eventually coalesced into a massive blue light. <br>

"Good Lord... it's interpreting Lucy's reverse thrust as hostile intent. <br>
It's going to destroy Lucy. Stop the reverse thrust now!" <br>
Andrew shouted, but it was too late. <br>

A blinding flash filled the screens, <br>
followed by a thunderous roar, and all monitor signals went dark. <br>
