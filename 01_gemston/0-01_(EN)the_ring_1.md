December 1, 2031, 8:13 AM (EST) <br>
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), <br>
Greenbelt, Maryland, MD 20771, USA <br>

The morning sunlight seeps warmly through the windows. <br>
Monitors scattered across the room display the trajectory of Lucy, the asteroid explorer, their screens alive with data streams and orbital paths. <br>

Through the vast control center drifts the Beatles' "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds" <br>

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green <br>
Towering over your head <br>
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes <br>
And she's gone <br>
Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br>
Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br>
Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br>

diamonds <br>
diamonds... <br>

The chorus repeats in his dreams. <br>
But Dr. Alan Kennedy, the center director, had no choice but to wake up. <br>

Andrew handed each of them a donut and coffee. <br>
Dr. Kennedy and the operator rubbed their eyes as they ate. <br>

"By the way, how many years until Lucy returns to Earth?"<br>
"It was launched to Jupiter the year you graduated, Andrew, so that would be 2021? Almost 10 years now."<br>
"Why is it flying over there when it needs to return to Earth..."<br>
"Lagrange point L4... we'll be there in half a day. We'll know soon enough."<br>
"That area is full of asteroids, looks like we're about to waste a billion-dollar probe." <br>

The center director, Dr. Peter Kennedy. <br>
The operator who's been tracking Lucy's trajectory for the past three days. <br>
And Andrew, who just brought coffee and donuts. <br>
These three were the only ones in the control center this early morning. <br>

"Expand the predicted path and take a look."<br>
The operator activated the L'LORRI camera mounted on Lucy. <br>
But the expected trajectory shows only empty space, with distant stars twinkling. <br>
Though some large asteroids can be faintly seen far off the path. <br>
