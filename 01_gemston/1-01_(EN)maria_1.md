Dawn, November 2, 1313.<br>
On the road to Bern, Switzerland. <br>

Through the snowstorm, across the highlands where the cold air of Lake Murten (Murtensee) lingers, <br>
a caravan of carriages can be seen making its way. <br>

"Maria's fever is getting worse." <br>
Her mother tenderly cools Maria's burning forehead. <br>
Though she's grown considerably taller in recent months as puberty approaches, <br>
her parents still cherish her like a baby. <br>

Her father, listening silently, doesn't turn his head. <br>
"Just hold on a little longer. We'll reach Bern in a day." <br>

At the head of the caravan is Maria's family, followed by their cousin's families. <br>
The end of the procession is marked by carriages loaded with noisy cargo pouches. <br>

"Why did we bring those stone chunks, making this journey so difficult..." <br>
"Dear... your mother might hear you." <br>

After searching everywhere for the kettle, she paused briefly. <br>
Opening the window and gazing up at the sky, she finally spoke after a long moment. <br>

"Perhaps you're the issue." <br>
As the curtains billowed in the wind, an unfamiliar smile appeared on Mother's face in the moonlight. <br>

"Though it's late, you should visit your grandmother now." <br>

Her grandmother lives alone in a cottage on the hill right next door. <br>
Already knowing Maria's next response, her mother added: <br>

"You can stay overnight if you'd like." <br>

Maria left through the back door to avoid waking the family. <br>
Wrapping herself in a cloak and taking a torch to light the night path, she headed toward the stable. <br>

But she stopped after just a few steps. <br>

The pouches of pebbles stored in the carriage by the stable were all emitting light, illuminating the street brightly. <br>
