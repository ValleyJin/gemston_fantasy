In the quiet streets of Bern, Switzerland, during the 13th century, an old tavern brimmed with life. Known as the starting point of a legendary tale passed down through generations, Maria's family gathered at a warm wooden table inside. With frosty mugs of beer in hand, they were ready to dive into stories of old.

"Grandfather, did the legend really start here?" Maria asked, her eyes wide with curiosity, sparkling with eagerness for the tale. "My legs are swollen from walking all day."

With a gentle smile, Grandfather nodded. "Yes, Maria. It's worth the trek you've made."

Foamy beer trickled down Grandfather's throat. "It all started right here. Long ago, the GemSTON began circulating among the miners."

Hans, sitting beside him, sipped only half his beer and turned to Grandfather. "Because of it, our ancestors wandered for centuries, far from home."

Grandfather paused, setting down his mug to rest a hand on Felix's shoulder. "From your pocket. Bring it out for us to see."

Felix, one of Maria's cousins, rustled in his bag and placed a gem on the table. "So where is this gem now? Is it still here in Bern?"

A faint smile fluttered across Grandfather's face like a memory. He glanced at an old painting on the tavern wall depicting the village in ancient times. He seemed to drift back through the ages as he began to speak.

Bern's night was tranquil. The stone path stretching over the hill echoed with the footsteps of miners returning from the salt mines. In this town famed for salt, a new rumor was spreading about an unknown gem called GemSTON. Though no one had seen it, the villagers whispered as if it were real.

Inside a small pub, the miners were unusually animated. The usual talk of salt was overtaken by tales of the mysterious gem.

"Have you heard? About the GemSTON," one miner raised his worn glass, his eyes alight with excitement.

"I swear it was opal I picked up in the salt mine. It was tangled with other rocks, hard to separate. It felt odd, calling it a rock or a gem, so let's just say GemSTON."

Another miner scoffed, "Nonsense. A gem that special? We don't even know where it is."

"That may be, but rumor has it, this isn't just any shining gem. Once it starts glowing, it never stops."

From across the table, young Maria listened quietly. She wanted to share her secret, but lacked the courage. That evening, she was to hear an ancient legend from her grandmother, a tale that seemed to connect with her secret.

"If this isn't just a rumor, what would you say then?" someone asked.

"Don't be foolish. A gem replacing a candle? Do you know how much we miners use candles? A light that never goes out, that's impossible."

That's when Maria joined their conversation. "What if such a gem existed? Would you believe it?" Her voice was gentle, but her question halted everyone.

The miners stared, puzzled. "Yes, girl. If such a gem existed, we'd believe. But it's nothing more than a fanciful tale."

Maria smiled quietly. She thought of the small GemSTON she held, which had started to glow a few days earlier and strangely, the light hadn't faded. Maybe this gem was the GemSTON they spoke of. And she felt she was beginning to understand its power.

Walking home under a clear night sky, she anticipated the story she would hear from her grandmother. Her grandmother's house was old but cozy. As she entered, her grandmother sat by the fire, an open jewel box beside her.

"Maria, it's time you heard the true story of this gem," her grandmother spoke softly, the GemSTON necklace sparkling in the firelight.

"It's not just any gem, my dear. Our family has guarded it for generations. And now, it's your turn to carry on this destiny."

Maria's eyes widened. "Can I use it too? Can I really wield its power?"

Her grandmother smiled. "Don't you already know, Maria? You can keep the light alive."

She couldn't believe it, but the gem in her hand continued to shine. That night, her grandmother told her a deeper tale. The GemSTON was more than a mere mineral. It was part of a legend passed down through Jewish lineage.

"Tell me more," Maria pleaded.

"Let's call it a night, my child," her grandmother decided, as Maria's eyes drifted towards sleep.
