# 6. The Start of a Hostile Fate
<br><br><br>
Spring came to Bern.<br>

Over the months that passed, Max became a hopeless drunkard, cursing Maria as a witch <br>
and claiming that her powers had ruined his candle trade. He apparently told everything to Grand Duke Cheringen.<br>

“They said the Duke sent a letter to the Papal Court. <br>
If there’s talk of a witch, they won’t ignore it.”<br>

Tipsy and reeling, Max wandered the town square, <br>
where a neatly dressed young man had just arrived—a newcomer in Max’s eyes, the perfect target to harass.<br>

“Hey, you’re not from around here, are you?”<br>
He barked out, then seized the man’s left shoulder in a forceful grip.<br>

“Ow!”<br>
Max recoiled as if he’d scorched his palm, stumbling onto the ground.<br>
“What the… your shoulder…?”<br>

“Why pick on random passersby, you hairy brute?”<br>
The young man, Cesar, glared down at Max sprawled out. <br>

Max scrambled upright, drawing a dagger from his belt and driving it at Cesar’s left shoulder.<br>
But the blade snapped in two, scattering strange metal shards from Cesar’s shoulder.<br>

“Huh? What is this…?”<br>
Dazed, Max found himself hoisted off the ground by Cesar’s left hand alone.<br>
That puzzling mechanical arm…<br>

“I came here to capture a witch. Is this your grand welcome?”<br>
“Huh… so you must be the one Grand Duke Cheringen mentioned…”<br>

Max dangled in midair, choking, <br>
quickly adopting a more polite tone as fear overshadowed him.<br>

“The guy is here… I can sense it.”<br>
In her home, Maria’s mother gazed at Bern’s evening glow, speaking under her breath.<br>

Grandmother, sipping tea beside her, gave a knowing nod.<br>
“Yes, the time has come for Maria to learn the truth.”<br>

Maria’s mother pondered how much to tell her daughter. <br>
She too had glimpsed terrifying visions via the Gemstones, seeing something like a demon’s form.<br>

That had frightened her so deeply, <br>
she felt she could never fully control the Gemstone, and thus avoided it, trying to forget.<br>

However, her visions only grew stronger, eventually turning into sequences of odd numbers, <br>
which she wrote down throughout her life.<br>

Only a few days earlier, she had finished that sequence, <br>
and no more numbers appeared.<br>

“Maria.”<br>
She softly called her daughter’s name and handed her a scroll.<br>

“I don’t know what these numbers mean, either. But keep it safe.”<br>
Maria’s wide eyes sparkled, reflecting the columns of digits.<br>

…<br>

Bang, bang, bang.<br>

A pounding on the door and Max’s bellow echoed. <br>
He had arrived with Cesar in tow, finding Maria’s house.<br>

Sensing fate, Maria’s mother removed the Gemstone pendant from her daughter’s neck and placed it on herself.<br>

“Mom, I’ll pray for you.”<br>
Maria pressed the Gemstone—now around her mother’s neck—between her hands.<br>

Leaning on her mother’s shoulder, she uttered a prayer.<br>

Wiping away tears, her mother steeled herself.<br>
She gently pushed Maria aside and boldly stepped outside to face Cesar.<br>

“Is this what you came for?”<br>
She gestured to the pendant around her own neck.<br>

“Haha. We’ve got plenty of those.”<br>
Cesar pulled a handful of Gemstones from his pouch, letting them glint in the lamplight.<br>
Then, with a stern look, he jerked his head, and soldiers rushed into the house to seize Maria.<br>

“What do you plan to do with my child? I won’t stand by!”<br>
In her fury, the Gemstone on her chest blazed crimson.<br>

“Oho, it does respond. Let’s see how you handle it, shall we?”<br>
Cesar raised a hand, and soldiers pressed a blade to Maria’s throat.<br>

Right then,<br>
the pendant around her mother’s neck erupted in a fierce flash, aiming at Cesar.<br>

He reflexively blocked with his left arm, which shattered into glinting metallic fragments. <br>
Among the shards, half of a Gemstone remained, still emitting a faint glow.<br>

That unleashed light ripped downhill, slicing the lake below in half, <br>
then zoomed on toward the town square, obliterating a fountain and Grand Duke Cheringen’s statue.<br>

Thud.<br>

A dull crack sounded as Maria’s mother collapsed, <br>
a soldier behind her having clubbed her on the head.<br>

“So here we have a real witch capable of fully commanding Gemstone power,” <br>
Cesar murmured, loading her into a carriage bound for the Vatican.<br>

Maria’s father, working in the mine at the time, arrived hours too late. <br>
His eyes stared blankly at the wreckage,<br>
lost and hollow. <br>
