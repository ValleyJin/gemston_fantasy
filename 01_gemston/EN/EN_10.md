# 10. Mining <br>
<br><br><br>

"Father, where are we going?"<br>
"To Obwalden. That damned empire took your mother, so we must fight them."<br>

Steering the rattling carriage, her father said nothing for a while.<br>
"That's the only way we can bring her back, isn't it?"<br>

Maria's eyes sparkled as she replied,<br>
"Mother is still alive. I can feel it."<br>

"The House of Habsburg is full of repulsive bastards."<br>
From the rear seat, Max interjected.<br>
"I heard there's a battle against them in Obwalden, and honestly, I couldn't sit still when I heard the news! Hahaha."<br>

"You could be rich just by monopolizing candle sales at your mine."<br>
Maria's father still eyed him with skepticism.<br>
"So why throw yourself into a war?"<br>

Max scoffed and leaned back onto the haystack.<br>
"Guess you Jews don’t quite understand us Swiss."<br>
He chuckled and stretched out his legs.<br>
"We hate interference. We’d rather just live quietly, watching the sun rise and set over these mountains."<br>

After biting off a chunk of bread, he added,<br>
"Politics? Empires? Wars? We don't care about any of that."<br>

Maria’s uncle looked at Max uneasily.<br>
"But why are you here, Max? What’s your real reason?"<br>

"Well… that’s a long story."<br>
Max scratched his head, as if hesitant.<br>
"Oh, let me explain instead," he said, straightening up.<br>

He recounted his encounter with Cesar—<br>
how he saw the terrifying mechanical left arm, its immense power,<br>
how it reeked of something unholy.<br>

And when Maria’s mother was taken away,<br>
he felt guilty.<br>

"So, from now on, I'll call you ‘big brother.’"<br>
Max clapped Maria’s father on the back.<br>
"I’ve been rude before. I’ll do my best to get your wife back. Hahaha!"<br>

As the sun set, darkness engulfed the road.<br>
Wolves howled in the distance.<br>
Max reached for a candle to hang on the front of the carriage,<br>
but then, he turned to Maria.<br>

"Wait, we don’t need this. Maria! Tie a Gemstone onto the carriage instead."<br>

Maria untied the cloth securing the Gemstone-filled sack.<br>
As she cupped one in both hands, a brilliant light emanated from within.<br>

"Ah, too bright."<br>
She quickly wrapped the Gemstone in another layer of cloth to dim it.<br>

"Father, I think the Gemstones' glow is getting stronger over time."<br>
"Really? I only ever collected them with your mother. I never paid close attention."<br>

"Back in the mine, we just used them for lighting."<br>
During the journey to Obwalden, Maria realized that the Gemstones were continuously mining—<br>
not in the human sense, but extracting power over time, growing stronger.<br>

.<br>

"Whoa! Whoa!!!"<br>

The horses suddenly whinnied in terror,<br>
rearing up wildly.<br>

Not far ahead, dozens of glowing blue eyes gleamed in the dark.<br>

"Wolves… When did they start following us?"<br>
Max grabbed a halberd and prepared to jump off the carriage.<br>

"Are you insane? That’s too many of them. Stay inside and hold your position!"<br>

The terrified horses galloped at full speed.<br>
Maria’s father struggled to rein them in,<br>
but they wouldn’t stop.<br>

"Brother, if we keep going like this, the carriage will tip over!"<br>

Her father had no choice.<br>
He cut the reins, releasing the horses.<br>

The freed animals bolted in all directions,<br>
and the wolves immediately chased them instead.<br>

They were stranded—<br>
left alone in the middle of the icy mountain pass.<br>

In the distance, the agonized cries of the horses echoed.<br>

"Maria, light a torch! And the rest of you, draw your weapons!"<br>

Barricading both ends of the carriage,<br>
the men prepared for an ambush.<br>

Thud!<br>

The lead wolf lunged at the rear entrance,<br>
but Maria’s uncle struck it with his spear, sending it stumbling backward.<br>

More wolves gathered, their snarls reverberating in the snow.<br>

"We’re outnumbered. They’ll rush in all at once!"<br>

Maria’s father swung his torch wildly to keep them at bay.<br>
Meanwhile, Maria clutched a Gemstone tightly,<br>
raising it toward the wolves.<br>

But… nothing happened.<br>

"Father, I don’t know how to trigger the light burst."<br>
"Didn’t you use it against Cesar before?"<br>

"That time, I was only holding it and praying for Mother."<br>

Her father didn’t have time to respond.<br>
The wolves advanced.<br>

"Then do that. Pray like you did before!"<br>

Maria threw away her torch,<br>
clasped the Gemstone between her hands,<br>
and prayed.<br>

A deep blue glow slowly emerged.<br>

"Ah… I finally understand how to use them!"<br>

FLASH!<br>

A brilliant burst of light erupted from the Gemstone,<br>
ripping through the wolves like a thunderclap.<br>

The air filled with the acrid stench of burning fur.<br>

The surviving wolves whimpered and fled.<br>

Maria’s father pulled her into an embrace.<br>
"You’ve saved us again, my daughter."<br>

"Father, the Gemstones are growing stronger…<br>
Where does this power even come from?"<br>

"I don’t know."<br>
Her father sighed.<br>
"And honestly, that scares me a little."<br>

They gathered themselves,<br>
secured the damaged carriage,<br>
and checked their supplies.<br>

Then, with no horses left,<br>
they tied ropes around their waists<br>
and pulled the carriage up the snowy incline.<br>

By dawn,<br>
they had finally reached the first village of Obwalden.<br>
