# 16. The Road to Uri <br>
<br><br><br>

Maria slowly drifted into sleep as the lights of Obwalden faded into the distance.  

Moments later, the sound of arrows slicing through the wind echoed.  
One arrow grazed Maria’s hair before embedding itself into the carriage.  
Then more followed.  

Whoosh.  
Whoosh.  
Whoosh.  

"Damn it. It looks like Obwalden has sent pursuers. Traitors."  

As the enemy closed in from all sides, the mercenary captain, Schneider, dismounted his horse and boldly drew his halberd.  

"So, there really was a bounty for capturing Maria alive."  

With a single swing of his halberd, two or three men had their legs severed.  

Yet, more villagers armed with pitchforks and spears swarmed around them.  
Despite their lack of skill, their sheer numbers overwhelmed the defenders.  

As Schneider grew weary, two nimble attackers clambered onto the back of the carriage and abducted Maria.  

Unaware of this, Schneider fought with all his might, barely surviving the assault. But by then, Maria had already been struck unconscious and bound, on her way back to Obwalden.  

The horses pulling the carriage had been savagely slaughtered.  
With no other option, Schneider grabbed a lantern and set off on foot in pursuit.  

---

The two men who had taken Maria were already reveling in their anticipated reward.  

"You tied her up properly, right?"  
The man leading the way glanced back.  

"Of course. Do you know how much she’s worth? Ha ha ha.  
Just keep running ahead—I can’t go as fast with Maria on my horse."  

The stout man leading the way nodded and suddenly shouted:  
"Once I get the bounty, I’m heading to Rome!"  

The words came out abruptly, even making him feel awkward.  
After all, he was choosing to abandon the land his ancestors had lived in for generations.  
Perhaps he was trying to justify his actions.  

"I’ve had enough of freezing and starving in this Swiss backwater.  
Right? With this bounty, I can finally settle down in—"  

He never finished his sentence.  

With a sickening thud, a mace flew from behind, shattering his skull.  

"Hmph... Splitting the bounty two ways would have been a waste."  

The wiry man riding behind Maria dismounted, walking over to look down at his fallen comrade’s bloodied body.  

"These Obwalden fools... Their problem is that they trust too easily."  
He let out a scoffing laugh before turning back.  

"Now then, Maria. Once I hand you over and claim the bounty, maybe I’ll go to Rome, too. That fat fool seemed to like the idea. Ha ha ha!"  

He climbed back onto his horse and tugged on the reins—  

Ping!  

A sharp metallic ring echoed through the air. An arrow had pierced the wiry man’s skull clean through.  

As he fell, he dragged Maria down with him, pinning her under his corpse.  

She gasped, struggling for air.  

Suddenly, a soft hand grasped hers and lifted her effortlessly.  

"Are you after the bounty, too?"  

"Ha ha ha. So those scum were bounty hunters, huh?"  

The darkness obscured the figure’s face.  
"Money? I’ve long had more than I need."  
His words were short and curt.  

Yet, something about him felt trustworthy.  
Maria hesitated before offering a small, grateful smile.  

"I woke up around the time they were talking about the bounty... It was terrifying."  

"I’ve been watching for a while. Looks like the situation is finally settled.  
I wonder if that burly guardian of yours is still alive?"  

He was referring to Schneider.  
Maria immediately asked to be taken to him.  

"Alright. Let’s go find him. First, though, let’s bring these lost horses along."  

He grabbed the reins of two stray horses and set off toward Schneider.  

Maria still didn’t know how to ride, so she had to hold onto the man’s back as they traveled.  

"So, little lady, what’s so special about you that you’ve got a bounty on your head?"  

"..."  

He was a stranger. Maria decided it was best to stay silent.  

The sound of hooves echoed through the dark road.  

"It’s hard to retrace our steps in the dark like this."  

With no guiding light, they had to slow their pace.  

Then, the man suddenly flinched.  
A pair of delicate hands had reached around his neck and clasped a large pendant around him.  

It was Maria’s gemstone.  

The glow of the gemstone illuminated the surroundings, making it easier to navigate.  

And in that light, Maria caught her first clear glimpse of the man.  

His lustrous brown hair and piercing blue eyes.  
A young man, barely past twenty.  
His clothing was anything but that of a commoner.  

"I came searching for a legendary stone of great power... and it turns out, it’s real."  
He absentmindedly ran his fingers over the gemstone pendant.  

Then, he turned slightly to glance at her.  

"Could it be that our little lady here is Maria?"  

Maria was startled.  

She didn’t even have time to ask *How do you know my name?*  

Before she could, the man extended his hand over his shoulder.  

"Might as well introduce ourselves. My name is Gerald."  

At that moment, a distant voice boomed through the night.  

"Maria! Maria!"  

It was Schneider.  

Gerald lifted the gemstone pendant high to signal back.  

Maria sent a silent prayer of gratitude to God.
