# 13. The Metal Armor That Vanished <br>
<br><br><br>

Outside, the sounds of trams and bustling tourists could be heard, though they were muffled inside the basement of Cafe Marta.<br>
Dr. Levi and Peter descended the stairs, their eyes widening at the brightness.<br>

Along the walls, shelves were stacked with crates of Gemstones, their glow filling the room as if it were broad daylight.<br>

“What’s that sound? Running water?”<br>
“Peter, we’re below the level of the Aare River. If we didn’t keep pumping water out, this place would flood.”<br>
“So, what do you use? An electric pump?”<br>
“No, we don’t need electricity. The Gemstones generate heat.<br>
The water channels around the perimeter are heated by them, creating convection currents that naturally pump the water out.”<br>

As they ventured deeper inside, the glow intensified.<br>
Scattered throughout the chamber were more powerful Gemstones of various colors, along with ancient parchment scrolls,<br>
relics like spears, shields, bows, and crossbows— weapons once wielded by the Gemstone Knights.<br>

A massive tapestry, emblazoned with the crest of Pope Clement V’s era, hung prominently.<br>

On the opposite wall, a red cloak, though faded, displayed golden buttons in a pattern so elaborate that it still exuded grandeur.<br>

“Incredible, isn’t it? According to these documents, this cloak once belonged to Cesar and was seized by the Gemstone Knights.”<br>
Dr. Levi flipped through an old manuscript.<br>

“Those bedtime stories you heard as a kid… they were just fragments of the real history.”<br>

He read aloud, reciting lines of Latin from the brittle parchment.<br>
Then, he opened a trunk adorned with the Rothschild family’s red shield emblem.<br>
Inside, however, was only a scroll filled with Roman numerals.<br>

“There should be something else… Gerald’s Metal Armor. It’s missing.”<br>
“How important is it?”<br>
“The armor bore **stigmata**—the imprint of Grandmother Maria’s palms.”<br>

He turned toward shelves stacked with historical records of their family.<br>
“Without Maria’s palm marks, the Gemstone’s full power cannot be unlocked.”<br>

As they left the basement, Peter turned to Dr. Levi.<br>
“I think the Rothschild family has it. But we don’t even know who they really are.”<br>
“So you have no direct contact with them?”<br>
“That’s not how things work these days, haha.<br>
The descendants of the Gemstone Knights communicate through blockchain networks now.<br>
It’s all about anonymity and transparency.”<br>

Dr. Levi returned upstairs to the cafe, opened his laptop, and logged into the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) created by the Gemstone Knights’ heirs.<br>
It was just one of many Ethereum-based DAOs, where proposals and discussions were encrypted.<br>

Much of the text appeared garbled—replaced by seemingly random character strings.<br>
Dr. Levi proposed an agenda via a smart contract, requesting the return of the armor.<br>

“I often wonder…” he murmured, “…how the descendants of those medieval Gemstone Knights are living now.”<br>

# 14. Swiss Mercenaries <br>
<br><br><br>

“Think about what Max told us last night. The Rothschild family stakes gold as collateral and lends out Gemstones… brilliant idea, sure, but would they really agree to it?”<br>
Maria’s father sipped his water, clearly nursing a hangover from the night before.<br>

“Father.” Maria watched him carefully, refilling his glass.<br>
“That means we have to leave some of our own Gemstones with them too, right?”<br>

An uneasy silence filled the room.<br>

“If I hoard all this power, eventually it will change me. It will change us.”<br>
“And what do we trust?”<br>

Maria nodded in thought. “My hands. Without me, the Gemstone’s power can’t be fully awakened, right?<br>
So we can safely lend them out if we keep the key separate.”<br>

“That might work. But first, we need to establish trust.”<br>
Maria’s father set down his soup with a grimace.<br>

“Who knows? If it’s God’s will…”<br>
Maria gave a small smile.<br>

Outside, Uncle Andrea entered, bringing news from the Swiss mercenaries.<br>
“Many regions are still deciding whether to join the fight, but the Habsburg forces are powerful. <br>
If we had Gemstones, many would flock to our side.”<br>

"That's right!" "So would we!" "Count us in!" "Here too!"<br>

Their eyes gleamed.<br>
The famed Swiss mercenaries were known across Europe, earning fortunes in single campaigns.<br>

“With only three cantons actively fighting, they’ll need these Gemstones. We should travel between them, lending Gemstones in exchange for gold.”<br>
“That way, more mercenaries will gather and return to Obwalden.”<br>
“Exactly!”<br>
Maria’s father and uncle clapped in agreement.<br>

Someone had to contact the Rothschild family to negotiate.<br>
Maria’s father muttered, “Who should go?”<br>

“I’ll go.”<br>
It was Max again.<br>

"You startled me! Where did you come from?"<br>
He emerged from beneath the table, rubbing his eyes.<br>

“It’s rumored their patriarch has fallen ill, and the eldest son has recently taken over.<br>
They might just be open to this deal now. The old man was too stubborn, saw no profit in it.”<br>

Everything moved swiftly from there.<br>
Switzerland was so decentralized that forming an alliance or launching a campaign required broad agreement from all regions.<br>
Public sentiment and meticulous planning were essential.<br>

“Can we really stand against the Imperial Army?”<br>
“They’re a unified force. One command, one front.”<br>
The nervous murmurs of inexperienced Obwalden villagers filled the air.<br>

At the headquarters, Commander Werner met with Maria’s father to discuss how to distribute Gemstones for war.<br>

“Schneider.”<br>
At the meeting’s conclusion, Werner called for the mercenary captain.<br>
“Yes, sir!”<br>
“Handpick your finest troops to escort Maria. She’ll travel to the three Swiss cantons to rally more warriors.”<br>

They hoped Maria’s Gemstone power would inspire more to rise up.<br>
“Keep her safe, please.”<br>
Maria’s father bowed deeply in gratitude.<br>

“Haha, worry not!”<br>
Schneider thumped his chest confidently.<br>
Maria rummaged through her sack and picked out a large Gemstone for Schneider.<br>
“You’re huge, so you need a big one too!”<br>
“Haha, thanks, young lady!”<br>

Within a week, Maria would set off across Switzerland.<br>
That midnight, restless, she went to her grandmother’s house.<br>
They whispered about old Gemstone legends until dawn.<br>
