# 28. The Duel <br>
<br><br><br>

A narrow forest path leading to **Habsburg Palace**.  

The wind carried only the rustling of leaves and the distant hoot of an owl.  

In the dim torchlight, **Cesar and Gerald stood facing each other.**  

The flickering flames stretched their shadows long against the cold, uneven ground.  

A tense silence hung between them.  

Gerald **gripped his sword tightly.**  

He had dueled countless times before.  
As a former **Templar**, he had fought among the best.  

"Cesar," he said, his voice steady.  
"You might win this duel, but if you harm my brother, I will end you myself."  

At the edge of the battlefield, Johan **stepped forward**,  
his expression unreadable.  

He handed Cesar a **sword and shield.**  

Cesar smirked.  

"You misunderstand.  
I do not fight for honor.  
I fight to **win.**"  

The moment the last word left his lips, **the duel began.**  

Swords clashed, sparks **flaring in the darkness.**  

Cesar moved **unnaturally fast.**  

The **Red GemSTONE embedded in his armor** pulsed with energy, enhancing his reflexes.  

Gerald quickly realized this was no ordinary fight.  

But he refused to back down.  

Instead, he shifted his strategy.  

Rather than overpowering Cesar, he aimed for **precision.**  

He spotted an **opening—Cesar’s left side.**  

He lunged.  

His blade **should have** sliced through flesh.  

Instead—  

**CLANG!**  

His sword struck something hard.  

Cesar **laughed.**  

"My left arm," he said, "is not made of flesh."  

It was **metal.**  

Reinforced with **GemSTONE-powered technology.**  

Gerald had no time to react.  

Cesar **twisted sharply**, driving his elbow into Gerald’s chest.  

The impact **knocked the breath out of him.**  

Before he could recover, Cesar grabbed his arm and wrenched it behind his back.  

Gerald gasped in pain.  

"You are skilled," Cesar admitted.  
"But not skilled enough."  

With a **final shove,** he sent Gerald **sprawling onto the ground.**  

The duel was over.  

Johan, who had been watching, finally stepped forward.  

"You have won," Johan said.  
"Now honor your word. Let my brother go."  

Cesar tilted his head as if considering the request.  

Then, he smiled.  

"A deal is a deal."  

He **stepped back.**  

But Gerald wasn’t finished.  

In an instant, he pulled a **dagger from his belt**  
and **thrust it toward Cesar’s chest.**  

Cesar barely dodged.  

His **eyes burned with fury.**  

"You just made a mistake."  

The **Red GemSTONE** on his chest **flared with blinding light.**  

An **invisible force** slammed into Gerald.  

He was **thrown backward.**  

He hit the ground **hard.**  

Cesar **loomed over him.**  

"I could kill you right now."  

Silence.  

Then, he **turned away.**  

"But I won’t. Not yet."  

With that, he **mounted his horse** and disappeared into the night.  

Gerald lay on the cold earth, breathing heavily.  

The duel was over.  

For now.

Gerald **staggered to his feet.**  

His body ached, but his mind remained sharp.  

Johan rushed over.  

"Are you alright?"  

Gerald wiped the blood from his lips and nodded.  

"We need to move. Now."  

Johan frowned.  

"Why? He let you live."  

Gerald shook his head.  

"He didn’t let me live.  
He’s **playing a game.**"  

A **distant whooshing sound** caught their attention.  

Both men turned toward it.  

In the distance, **flames erupted.**  

The **Metal Armor** Cesar had left behind was **burning.**  

Gerald’s eyes **widened.**  

"That’s not possible."  

Johan **grabbed his arm.**  

"Whatever this is, we can’t stay here."  

The flames grew **higher,**  
the **metal glowing white-hot.**  

Sparks **danced like fireflies.**  

Then—  

**BOOM.**  

A sudden **explosion.**  

The blast sent both men **tumbling backward.**  

When Gerald lifted his head,  

**the armor was gone.**  

Not **destroyed.**  

Not **melted.**  

**Gone.**  

The earth where it had stood remained **untouched.**  

Johan’s voice trembled.  

"Where did it go?"  

Gerald clenched his fists.  

"It’s not gone."  

He turned toward the horizon,  
where the last embers of the fire **faded into darkness.**  

"It’s been **taken.**"  

They had no doubt.  

Cesar was still **one step ahead.**  

And now, he had something **even more powerful.**
