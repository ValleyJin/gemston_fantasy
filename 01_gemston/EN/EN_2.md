“My dear Peter,  <br>
I, your grandfather, already arrived here in Bern earlier this month.  <br>
I’ve been wandering about, taking in the sights.  <br>
<br>
Abigail’s group, it seems, has also departed from Australia,  <br>
so let’s meet tomorrow evening at Cafe Marta as planned.  <br>
<br>
Be sure to bring a sample of the GemSTON.  <br>
After all, our family donated it in the first place. Borrowing it briefly shouldn’t cause any trouble, right?”  
<br><br>
.  <br>
.  <br>

<br>

Peter Levi re-checks the messenger app on his phone as he steps into Cafe Marta.  
<br>
“Name on the reservation?”  <br>
“Andrew Levi. Big fellow, white beard, my grandfather.”  <br>
“Ah, over there by the entrance to the underground storage room. They’re already seated.”  
<br><br>
“Grandfather!!!”  <br>
Peter dashes over and throws his arms around his grandfather.  
<br>
By now, Dr. Andrew Levi truly fits the title of “Grandfather.”  <br>
He can’t recall the last time all these grandchildren were together in one place.  
<br>
Many of them, scattered across the globe, have come a long way.  <br>
They greet one another with cheerful hugs and kisses, turning the café into a small uproar.  
<br>
Then, Dr. Levi gets right to the point.  <br>
“You brought it, right? Put it on the table.”  <br>
“What if people see? Come on, Grandpa…”  
<br>
“They’ll think it’s just a trinket. This is Bern, a famous tourist spot. And besides, we’re in a café serving alcohol.”  <br>
“Oh, please. Cafe Marta isn’t actually a bar—you’re the one who ordered the drinks, Grandpa, haha.”  <br>
Abigail, whose eyes gleam with curiosity, rubs her grandfather’s shoulders in a playful reproach.  
<br><br>
Peter, who’s only just arrived, plops down in a chair.  <br>
After rummaging through his bag for a moment, he sets a jewel on the table.  <br>
Inwardly, he wonders why his grandfather is being unusually careless today.  
<br>
Suddenly, a radiant light flares across the table, bright enough to illuminate the entire area.  
<br>
“Ooooh…”  
<br><br>

<br><br><br>

“It’s still under analysis, and I took it without official permission,”  <br>
Peter grumbles.  <br>
“By the way, how did our ancestors wear something that large around their necks?”  <br>
Abigail gently runs her fingers over the gemstone, intrigued.  
<br>
“If they find out at CERN, I’ll be kicked out. Do you know how hard it was to land that job?”  <br>
Peter still wears a look of reluctance.  <br>
Seeing that, Dr. Levi glances at him and gives a small nod.  
<br>
“Sorry about that. Since we don’t have a high-output synchrotron on our side, I had to ask you to analyze it. Thanks for that.”  <br>
Peter nods in agreement.  
<br>
“And Peter, you know the drill, right? Experiments must always be…”  <br>
Dr. Levi gives a sly wink, prompting Peter to finish the sentence:  
<br>
“…unofficial.”  
<br><br>
“Ah, such trouble. Our family used to be miners for generations, and now we have a ‘scientist’ who digs into physics instead.”  <br>
The other grandchildren chuckle.  <br>
“You’d better not get caught, or you’ll be out on the street—haha.”  <br>
Christian passes a beer mug to Dr. Levi and chimes in,  <br>
“This guy goes digging in books while we dig in the ground.”  
<br>
Each grandchild shows off a piece of jewelry—a necklace, earrings, or a bracelet.  <br>
“But we’re richer for it, haha.”  <br>
“Gems are trickier to grow into a business than physics, right, Peter?”  
<br><br>
Night descends upon the quiet streets of Bern, Switzerland.  <br>
On a side alley stands this old café, abuzz with unusual energy tonight.  <br>
Perhaps it’s because the descendants of Maria’s family—who once departed from here long ago—have finally returned?  
<br>
The beers they ordered arrive at the table.  <br>
Abigail licks her lips and lifts her head to tie her long hair back.  <br>
Then she notices two paintings on the opposite wall.  <br>
She steps closer, examining them carefully.  
<br>
On the left is a towering figure wielding a massive halberd.  <br>
Embedded in the chest of his armor is an enormous, glowing jewel.  
<br>
Abigail compares the brilliant gemstone on the table to the one in the painting.  <br>
She quickly realizes they’re the same type of jewel.  
<br>
On the right is a medieval portrait of a young girl.  <br>
“Is that the legendary Grandmother Maria?”  <br>
she asks Dr. Levi.  <br>
“That’s correct.”  <br>
“It looks genuinely ancient.”  <br>
“It’s nearly a thousand years old. Passed down through our Levi family line.”  
<br><br>
Dr. Levi also stands to get a closer look.  <br>
He studies whether the painting’s symmetry is still intact.  
<br>
“What are those coin-shaped holes in Grandmother Maria’s palms?”  <br>
Peter interjects, curious.  
<br>
Instead of answering directly, Dr. Levi shifts the conversation.  <br>
“The first thing I did after buying this café yesterday was to hang these paintings.”  <br>
“What?”  <br>
Those munching on sausages and sipping their beers freeze mid-bite, intrigued.  <br>
“You already owned the building, but you actually bought out the café business inside it? Whatever for?”  <br>
Abigail jumps in, worried Dr. Levi might deflect with another story.  
<br>
“I only hinted at telling some old tales, but that’s just the beginning. This old man has plenty to do right here,”  <br>
Dr. Levi says with a grin, surreptitiously stealing the freshly cut white sausages from Peter’s plate.  <br>
“Of course, I’ll still sleep at your place, Peter.”  <br>
The grandchildren start giggling all over again.  
<br><br>
“Grandpa, you told us over the phone, but it’s honestly hard to believe,”  <br>
Peter says bluntly.  <br>
“These are the same bedtime stories we heard as children. How could any of that be real now? We’re grown-ups, remember?”  
<br>
Abigail looks amused, her large eyes flicking between Peter and Dr. Levi.  <br>
She gives a faint laugh, resting her chin on one hand.  <br>
Meanwhile, some of the other grandchildren still gaze intently at their grandfather, clearly wanting to hear more.  
<br>
“Wow… what’s with everyone? Why so serious?”  <br>
Abigail asks, glancing around in disbelief.  <br>
The oldest grandchild, Christian, speaks up,  <br>
“There were times our family legends felt more like facts than fantasy, especially since we’ve long been in the gem business.”  
<br><br>
“Oh, they’re definitely real.”  <br>
Dr. Levi downs some frothy beer, clearing his throat.  
<br>
“All these stories trace back to Bern. From the start, this jewel only ever reacted to the women in our lineage.”  <br>
He strokes the jewel.  <br>
The gem’s luminescence flickers gently, lending a dreamy glow to Dr. Levi’s faint smile—a man well past seventy.  
<br>
Then he gazes up once more at the ancient painting on the wall and quietly begins his tale.  <br>
His grandchildren have heard the story countless times, but somehow, amid the refreshing Bernese night air, it all seems possible.
