“My dear Peter, <br>
I, your old Grandpa, arrived in Bern earlier this month, <br>
and took some time to look around. <br>

Abigail’s group left Australia, too, <br>
so let’s meet at Cafe Marta tomorrow evening as planned. <br>

Bring the GemSTON sample. <br>
It’s ours anyway, so borrowing it for a bit shouldn’t be an issue, right?” <br>

. <br>
. <br>
. <br>

Peter (Peter Levi) rechecked that message and stepped into Cafe Marta. <br>

“Do you have a reservation name?” <br>
“Andrew Levi. A tall older gentleman with a white beard.” <br>
“Ah, over by the basement storeroom entrance. They’re all here already.” <br>

“Grandpa!” <br>
Peter dashed over and gave his grandfather a hug. <br>

Dr. Andrew Levi—now well into his senior years—looked just as delighted to see all his grandchildren. <br>
It had been ages since they all gathered like this. <br>

The various grandchildren, scattered around the world, were also excited to reunite. <br>
They spent a good while hugging, greeting, and making a ruckus. <br>

All of a sudden, Dr. Levi said, <br>
“You brought it, right? Put it on the table.” <br>
“What if people see, Grandpa? You’re too casual about this…” <br>

“Eh, they’ll think it’s just a souvenir. This is Bern, a big tourist city, with all these pubs.” <br>
“Come on, Grandpa. Cafe Marta isn’t a pub. You’re the one who insisted on ordering beer, haha.” <br>
Abigail, sharp-eyed, massaged her grandfather’s shoulders. <br>

Peter, having just arrived, plopped into a chair and fished around in his bag. He pulled out a jewel and set it on the table. <br>
He thought Grandpa was being uncharacteristically careless today. <br>

Instantly, the table lit up with an iridescent glow. <br>

“Oooh…” <br>

“I borrowed this sample without official permission. If they find out, I could get booted from CERN,” <br>
Peter grumbled. <br>
“Hey, how did our ancestors even wear such a massive stone?” <br>
Abigail lightly touched the gem, marveling at its radiance. <br>

“Yeah, if they notice, I’m out at CERN. It was tough enough getting that job,” <br>
Peter said, still dissatisfied. <br>
Dr. Levi gave him a quick nod of reassurance. <br>
“Sorry about that. Since we don’t have a high-powered synchrotron on our end, I needed your help for analysis.” <br>
Peter nodded in return.  
“And you remember, everything is…”  
Dr. Levi gave a playful wink.  
“Off the record.”  

“Good grief. Our family used to be miners, but now we’ve produced a fancy scientist, huh?” <br>
Some other grandchildren snickered. <br>
“You watch yourself, man! You can’t get fired. Haha.” <br>
Offering Dr. Levi a mug of beer, Christian chimed in, <br>
“We used to dig in the dirt. He just digs into books.” <br>
They all displayed the jewels they wore as necklaces, earrings, or bracelets. <br>
“But we’re richer, haha. Building a whole jewelry business is probably tougher than your physics, Peter.” <br>

Bern’s old quarter was calm this night, <br>
but the small cafe bustled with unusual liveliness. <br>
Maybe because the descendants of Maria’s family, who left here long ago, had all come to visit. <br>

Their beers arrived at the table. <br>
Abigail licked her lips, pulling her long hair back. <br>
She glanced up at the wall, noticing some paintings hanging there. <br>
Curious, she stood and examined them. <br>

One painting showed a giant wielding a huge halberd. <br>
A large gemstone glowed on his chest armor. <br>

She looked back and forth between the shining gem on the table <br>
and the painted gem in the artwork. <br>
They were obviously of the same type. <br>

Another painting, from the medieval era, depicted a young girl. <br>
“Is that Grandma Maria from the old legend?” <br>
Abigail asked Dr. Levi. <br>
“Yes, it is.”  
“It looks ancient.” <br>
“Nearly a thousand years old. Passed down in the Levi family for centuries.” <br>

Dr. Levi rose and joined her, studying the painting’s symmetry. <br>

“What’s that circular mark like a coin hole in her palms?” <br>
Peter asked, stepping closer. <br>

Dr. Levi didn’t answer directly. Instead, he changed the subject. <br>
“Yesterday, I bought this cafe from its old owners. First thing I did was hang these paintings.” <br>
“Huh?” <br>
All the grandchildren paused—some cutting into sausage, some sipping beer—staring at him. <br>
“You owned the building, but you actually bought out the cafe business? Why? What are you planning?” <br>
Abigail quickly interjected, before he could dodge the question. <br>

“I only told you I’d share a bit of an old family story. This is merely the beginning. I’ve got more to do here.” <br>
Grinning, Dr. Levi casually stole a piece of Peter’s neatly cut white sausage onto his own plate. <br>
“I’ll crash at your place tonight, though,” he teased. <br>
The grandchildren kept giggling. <br>

“Grandpa, you explained over the phone, but we still can’t believe it,” <br>
Peter said abruptly. <br>
“All those bedtime legends we heard as kids… how could any of it be real? We’re not little kids anymore.” <br>

Abigail, apparently amused, flicked her gaze between Peter and Dr. Levi. <br>
Then she gave a half laugh, resting her chin in one hand. <br>
But the other grandchildren were now staring keenly, as if waiting for a revelation. <br>

“Wow. Everyone is so serious,” <br>
Abigail mused, scanning the room. The oldest grandson, Christian, finally spoke up. <br>
“I was always curious. Our jewelry business thrived, and these old legends sometimes felt too real.” <br>

“It’s real, all right,” <br>
Dr. Levi said, taking a swig of foamy beer. <br>

“It all began here in Bern, with this gem that only responded to the women in our family.” <br>
He stroked the gleaming stone on the table. <br>
The jewel’s self-luminous glow flickered gently, illuminating the faint smile on the older man’s face. <br>

Then he looked once more at the ancient painting on the wall, speaking quietly. <br>
To his grandchildren, who had heard this legend a hundred times before, <br>
the crisp Bern night air gave them the sense anything might be possible. <br>
