<br><br><br>

November 2, 1313, near dawn. <br>
On the road heading to Bern, Switzerland. <br>

The chill of Lake Murten (Murtensee) swept across the high plains, <br>
while a caravan of carriages pushed through a raging snowstorm. <br>

“Maria’s burning up with a fever.” <br>
Maria’s mother gently tried cooling her daughter’s forehead. <br>
Perhaps puberty was setting in; Maria had shot up in height these past few months, <br>
yet her parents still doted on her like a child. <br>

Her father said nothing, not even turning his head. <br>
“Hang in there a bit. We’ll reach Bern in about a day.” <br>

The first carriage held Maria’s immediate family, followed by her cousins’ wagons, <br>
and at the end came several wagons stacked high with cargo sacks, rattling noisily. <br>

“What’s the point of lugging around all those rocks…?” <br>
“Shh, dear… Mother-in-law might hear you.” <br>
“That woman’s wishes can’t be denied… Good grief.” <br>
“This family has been miners for generations. You know how it is.” <br>
Maria’s grandmother dozed off in the seat, lulled by the carriage’s rocking, the perfect sedative. <br>

Awooo… <br>

“Wolves, huh? In winter, they’d be starving. Hey, Andrea! They’ll target the last wagon.” <br>
“I’ll go check.” <br>

A hulking alpha wolf led a pack loping forward. <br>
The last carriage, loaded with cargo, was pulled by two strong, well-fed horses. <br>
Andrea caught the glint in the wolves’ eyes under the torchlight; they looked ravenous indeed. <br>

“Damn beasts.” <br>
He waved his torch to scare them off, <br>
then hurled it at the lead wolf. <br>

He lashed his horse to the wagon, climbed atop the cargo bed, <br>
and frantically tore open sacks of rocks, flinging them into the darkness. <br>
Before long, a stone struck one unlucky wolf square in the forehead, echoing a shrill yelp across the snow. <br>

But the tang of blood only enraged the others, at least fifty strong, launching a full-on assault. <br>

“Andrea!!! Once we reach the edge of the lake, I’ll swerve hard. Hold on!” <br>
Maria’s father shouted from the lead. <br>
But Andrea was busy fending off a wolf clawing onto the cargo bed. <br>
He pitched a whole sack of rocks at it, lost his balance, and tumbled backward. <br>

Thud. <br>
He crashed onto a sack, half-knocking himself out. <br>
Maria’s father had executed his plan, yanking the carriage around sharply right at the shore of Lake Murten. <br>

“Three… two… one…” <br>
At that exact moment, <br>
the cargo-laden wagon unleashed a tremendous burst of light. <br>
It illuminated the frozen lake and glacier-lined valley like midday. <br>
The wolf pack, charging at full speed, was suddenly blinded, unable to change course— <br>
they plummeted into the lake en masse. <br>

<br><br><br>

Maria’s father sensed a flash behind him. Even squinting, it was too brilliant to face. <br>

“What on earth…?” <br>
He felt as though his eyes would pop out from the glare. <br>

Just then, <br>
“Honey!!! Look at Maria!” <br>
Maria’s mother cried out. <br>
Both her hands and Maria’s skirt were suddenly soaked in blood. <br>

The faint dawn rose over the horizon. <br>

<br><br><br>

Ten days passed after Maria’s family arrived at a remote mountain village near Bern. <br>

Because it lay high in the mountains, night fell quickly. <br>
Mere moments before, the slope had been touched by sunlight, <br>
but now the footsteps of salt-mine workers heading home echoed in the twilight. <br>

Inside a local tavern thick with the aroma of meat stew, <br>
Maria’s father looked at a candle. <br>
The flickering light brought out the deep lines in his face. <br>
Uncle Andrea’s head was bandaged from the injuries he sustained on the wagon. <br>

“We barely made it here, and they’re not even buying candles. What a rotten place…” <br>
He downed half his beer. <br>

“You can’t afford fancy candles anyway, not after losing all your gold in Rome,” <br>
his wife remarked as she sipped soup. <br>

“They call themselves a holy empire, but in Rome they just do whatever vile deeds they please.” <br>
He tore some bread, dipping it in the soup before setting it aside. <br>
“Our family lost so many toiling in the mines, <br>
only to be exiled with nothing but worthless lumps of stone for compensation…” <br>

“Where there’s misfortune, there’s also good. Our Maria’s grown into a fine young lady—something to celebrate.” <br>
“She started her first monthly cycle amidst all that chaos… Talk about timing.” <br>
“Honestly, I nearly fainted. I thought she was injured badly.” <br>
“Dear, about that flash that blinded the wolves—what in God’s name was that?” <br>
“I’m clueless. You couldn’t open your eyes either, right? It was just blazing all around us.” <br>

But oh well, <br>
it drove off the wolves, <br>
and after three months on the road, they were finally in Bern. Now they had to figure out how to survive. <br>
He glanced around the table, where the family—Maria, her brother Hans, and some cousins—were gathered, about a dozen mouths to feed. <br>

“With so many to feed, I’d better find mining work. Otherwise…” <br>
He trailed off, finishing the last of his beer. <br>
“You’ll manage. Take heart, dear.” <br>
But her reassurance seemed weaker than half a mug of beer. <br>

“Brother, be strong. People here treated us exiled Jews better than anywhere else. We should be grateful.” <br>
Uncle Andrea squeezed his brother’s hand. <br>

“If we don’t land a mining job soon, I’ll head out as a mercenary with Andrea, so keep that in mind.” <br>
Their father clasped Andrea’s hand back. They exchanged a long, calm gaze. <br>

“How many mercenaries survive, anyway? Don’t say that in front of the kids.” <br>
“Look around—everyone here does that. Guess we’ll have to do the same.” <br>
A hush fell over the entire family. <br>

Maria, fiddling with a few pebbles, noticed her father’s eyes. <br>
She and Hans were so young still, tears welling in their eyes as they clutched the small stones. <br>
Maria hugged Hans to keep him from crying, then bowed her head, squeezing the pebbles tightly. <br>

“At least I won’t be a useless father.” <br>
At his weary remark, tears fell from Maria’s cheeks onto the pebbles in her grasp. <br>

“Dad!” <br>
Suddenly Maria stood, brandishing the sack of stones, smiling brightly. <br>
She was cheerful by nature, always trying to reassure him with her confident gaze. <br>

“I’ll sell these! I’ll wander the village and trade them for candles!” <br>

<br><br><br>

Crash! <br>
The tavern rattled. <br>
A huge man nearly got stuck in the doorway, the wood creaking under his bulk. <br>

“Oh, Maximilian! Did you haul in anything good today?” <br>
“Just your luck if you left some behind for us, Max.” <br>
“Hey folks, Max is here. Bring the big keg of beer!” <br>

A brawny figure known as Max surveyed the tavern, deliberately sitting next to Maria’s father, <br>
placing a giant paw on the table that groaned under the weight. <br>

“Earlier, I saw you whining for candles outside the mine, you Jewish fellow.” <br>
Max smirked at the older man’s profile. <br>

“No candles come into this town without my say-so, you hear? <br>
I’m the only licensed chandler under Grand Duke Cheringen. You’re just some tax-dodging nobody…” <br>

He never finished the sentence. Their mother cried out, <br>
because Maria’s father wordlessly stood and mashed each burning candle on the tables with his mug, snuffing them out. <br>

“You crazy old—this is my tavern. <br>
You got money to pay for those candles?” <br>
Max drew a blade from its sheath, glowering fiercely. <br>
He flipped the table with a violent shove. <br>

“If you can best me in a duel, I won’t charge you for the damage.” <br>

Max grabbed a sword from the wall and tossed it to Maria’s father. <br>
Their mother had collapsed in fright, and Maria and Hans tried to rush over, only for Uncle Andrea to hold them back. <br>
Tears brimmed in Maria’s large eyes. <br>

With one hand, Max easily flung Maria’s father into a corner, sending his sword flying upward. <br>

At that instant, a brilliant light suddenly flashed from behind, striking Max’s blade in reflection, and momentarily blinding him. <br>
He jerked around, nearly twisting his neck. <br>

. <br>
. <br>
. <br>
. <br>

People watched in confusion, for the candles had all been extinguished, yet the tavern was glowing as bright as day. <br>

Amid hushed murmurs, they saw the source of the dazzling glare. <br>

It was Maria. <br>
She had been shoved into an alcove earlier by Uncle Andrea to keep her out of harm’s way. <br>

But that wasn’t all. <br>
The pebbles on the table glowed even more intensely than the candles had before. <br>

“Mister, can you… use these instead of candles?” <br>
said Maria, tears swelling in her wide eyes. <br>
She looked up at Max with a bright grin. <br>

“What in the world did you do?” <br>

Their mother, uncle, and cousins ran out of the tavern, utterly startled. <br>
Maria, on the verge of tears, could barely speak until her mother arrived to hold her tight. <br>

Riding piggyback on her mother, Maria left for home in haste. <br>
After tucking Maria in to sleep, her mother gently awakened her. <br>

“Maria.” <br>

“…Mom, sorry. It’s because of those stones, right?” <br>
“The stones aren’t the real issue.” <br>

Still thirsty, her mother grabbed a cup of water. <br>
She fiddled with the kettle, then paused, opening the window to gaze at the moon for a while before speaking: <br>

“Perhaps you’re the real problem.” <br>
The moonlight cast a strange smile on her mother’s face, the curtains swaying in the breeze. <br>

“It’s late, but go see Grandma now.” <br>

Maria’s grandmother lived alone in a tiny cottage on the nearby hill. <br>
Maria’s mother, anticipating her daughter’s next words, preempted them with: <br>

“You can stay there overnight if you want.” <br>

So Maria slipped out the back door, making sure not to wake the rest of the family. <br>
She threw on a cloak, lit a torch, and headed for the stable. <br>

But she stopped after only a few steps. <br>

Next to the stable stood their wagon, filled with sacks of small pebbles that shone so brightly <br>
they illuminated the entire road. <br>
