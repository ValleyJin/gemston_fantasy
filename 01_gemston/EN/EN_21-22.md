The majestic Habsburg Palace in Switzerland, where soldiers stand in formation.  
As the sun sets, a strong wind sweeps across the plains.  

"Our Habsburg family also started in Switzerland, yet we must suppress our own people this way?"  
"We have already established our base in Austria.  
Stop emphasizing that we hail from some Swiss countryside now that we are a core principality of the Holy Roman Empire."  

Leopold I inspected his troops with an air of authority, but his cousin’s snide remarks irritated him.  

"Brother, do not forget that it was my efforts that gathered the elite troops of the Habsburg royal family here."  
Leopold paused for a moment and whispered into his cousin’s ear.  

"Esencino, I will see in battle whether the men you have gathered are truly skilled.  
If you have brought a rabble just to test the waters, you will die by my hand."  

Leopold I spurred his horse aggressively, raising his ceremonial longsword high into the sky and shouted with grandeur,  
"Soldiers of the Empire! The Swiss Confederacy dares to defy our empire,  
gathering witches' sons, Jews, and wandering mercenaries to throw this land into chaos."  

"The Pope believes we shall restore the glory of the ancient Roman Empire.  
We are the army of God, destined to rebuild the Empire!"  

"WAAAAH!!!"  
The armored knights and infantry erupted into cheers.  
Watching their formation, Leopold I was pleased.  

"When our imperial heavy cavalry breaks through their front lines,  
all we need to do is follow and behead the remnants.  
There is no need to fear these Swiss peasants!"  

Leopold I had an exceptional gift for oration.  
His voice, a unique mix of multiple tones, boomed across the army, mesmerizing them.  
Every time he spoke, soldiers from the left and right ranks roared in unison.  

"A messenger has arrived!"  
Upon hearing the report, Leopold I read the scroll atop his horse.  

"Sir Otto and the Lord of Lucerne have already entered the canton of Schwyz."  
"As the vanguard fortifies their positions, we must join them quickly!"  
"We dispersed our troops to maintain the element of surprise, but if we do not regroup soon, we risk being defeated in detail!"  

Leopold I and his strategists exchanged views urgently.  

"It is odd that there has been no resistance."  
"The sight of our knights in shining armor marching in formation must have terrified those peasants."  

Leopold I spread out a map.  
"The shortest route to our rendezvous point in Schwyz is through the Morgarten Pass."  

"This main force includes cavalry. Leading such a large army through a narrow gorge carries many risks."  
His lieutenants hesitated.  

"Do these peasants even know what cavalry is? Do they understand war?  
By now, they are likely trembling in fear, building stone walls in Schwyz."  

"The Lord of Lucerne crossed Lake Aegeri first and encountered no resistance.  
We should also pass through quickly."  
The field reports from his scouts bolstered Leopold I’s confidence.

# 22. The Battle of Morgarten <br>

**November 15, 1315**  

The fateful day.  

"Caesar, we've been lying in ambush at Morgarten Pass for three days. How much longer must we wait?"  
"Our supplies are running low, and the weather is turning bitterly cold."  

Caesar remained hidden beside a boulder at the summit of the Morgarten Pass, overlooking Lake Aegeri.  
He did not move an inch.  

"You saw it yourselves—after the Lord of Lucerne passed, the Swiss peasant militia stacked boulders throughout the gorge."  
"Yes, sir. We should send a warning to Emperor Leopold I before it is too late."  
"Shut up. You know nothing."  

Caesar calmly stroked the fur of the raccoon Tori and sipped his tea.  

"We have no interest in this war. Maria will undoubtedly come here with the GemSTONE to aid the militia.  
We must observe how she uses it. Have you stationed scouts around the area?"  

His officers nodded, checking their signal beacons and bows for communication.  

"They're coming."  

A narrow path ran along Lake Aegeri.  
At its head, Leopold I's cavalry column advanced.  

"That fool Leopold is marching to his death."  

*Whiiiizzz!*  

An arrow sliced through the air.  
The leading knight, guiding Leopold I, took an arrow straight through his helmet and collapsed.  

*Thwip! Thwip! Thwip!*  

A rain of arrows blackened the sky, striking only the cavalry and their mounts.  
In an instant, the narrow passage between the lake and the cliffs was clogged with fallen knights and horses.  
The soldiers behind, unaware of the ambush, kept advancing blindly, tripping over the dead and trampling each other.  

"Stop! Stop! Halt the march, you fools!"  
Leopold I bellowed in panic.  
His trumpeters blared the retreat signal, but the army, packed into the narrow pass, struggled to reform.  

And then, it happened.  

From above, the hidden militia used levers to send boulders crashing down into the gorge.  

*RUMBLE! CRASH! CRASH!*  

The terrified horses reared and bolted.  
The formations dissolved into chaos as soldiers were crushed, drowned in the lake, or cut down.  

When half of the imperial army had fallen, the peasant militia, wielding halberds and farming tools, began their descent from the cliffs.  
Leopold’s forces, trapped on both sides, flailed in futile resistance.  

Each militiaman wore a glowing GemSTONE around his neck.  
Somehow, they wielded their heavy weapons with supernatural ease, swinging them effortlessly through the air.  

"It is the GemSTONE, after all."  
Caesar, watching through his spyglass, signaled his scouts.
