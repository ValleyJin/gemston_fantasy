# 20. Battle Formation <br>

"Impressive."  
Gerald observed the well-fortified defenses, from the sturdy walls to the array of weapons.  

"You've been fighting this war for over thirty years?"  
"Swiss people are stubborn. They detest interference."  
Their replies were brief but firm.  

"Then again, Gerald, don’t you also despise interference? Ha ha."  
"Exactly! That’s why you left the Templar Knights, isn’t it?"  
"Your older brother is still with the Templars, isn't he?"  
"Yet here you are, helping us instead! Ha ha!"  
"And you’re even marrying a ‘witch,’ they say!"  

Hearing this, Maria blushed.  

Laughter filled the air, but Gerald’s expression turned serious.  

"The Templars have changed."  

However, many still held deep reverence for the Templar Order. Even in Switzerland, their influence was significant.  
When Gerald criticized them, the mood turned tense.  

"They engaged in usury and lost the Pope’s favor."  
Murmurs spread among the group.  

"Every noble cause starts pure, but over time, power becomes too great to control."  

Meanwhile, in the town square, Maria distributed gemstones based on the amount of gold contributed by each of the three regions.  

"That is why Maria is sharing the gemstones.  
Power corrupts when it remains in one person’s hands."  

The exchange was nearly complete.  
Gerald oversaw the gold’s transport to the family’s bank vault.  

"Now that each of the three cantons has received their gemstones, what next?"  

Maria gathered the Northern European warriors who had joined them in Schwyz.  

"First, when you bring the gemstones to the battlefield, group them into piles."  
"Second, each of you must wear a gemstone necklace."  
"Third, simply being near the gemstone piles will amplify your strength."  

Maria lifted a halberd taller than herself with a single hand.  

Under normal circumstances, the weight would have been unbearable.  

But at the center of the training field lay a large sack of gemstones, glowing fiercely with a blue light.  

Everyone within its vicinity felt their physical strength and mental resolve multiply several times over.  

Maria twirled the halberd before hurling it.  

It spun through the air and embedded itself in an ancient oak tree on the far side of the lake.  

The hundred-year-old tree split in two with a deafening crack.  

---

Leopold I and his Habsburg forces were expected to charge with knights in the front ranks.  

The Swiss strategy had always been simple: form tight defensive formations and withstand the assault.  

But now, with the gemstones enhancing their resilience, they had a new strategy—  

They would withstand the charge, then counterattack at the right moment.  

Could it work?  

Facing down armored knights wielding lances, while holding nothing but wooden shields—  

The key lay in trust.  

Their confidence grew with each training session, as they drilled all summer long.  

By autumn, the air was thick with the knowledge that war was imminent.  

"Defense alone won’t be enough."  
General Werner shook his head.  
"Summon Captain Schneider."  

When Schneider arrived, Werner unrolled a map and began sketching.  

"Maria gathered warriors from across the north during her pilgrimage, correct?"  
"Yes, and they’ve trained well."  
"We must use them differently from the ordinary militia."  

Werner wrote down names on a scroll.  
"Bring me the ones I list here."  

After extensive research and observation, Werner had devised an elite strike force.  

"First, the Celtic priestess’s twin sons, Henkel and Aidan.  
Henkel can receive and distribute gemstone energy across a wide range."  

"He will serve as the energy link—the ‘Linker.’"  
Schneider nodded.  

"His brother, Aidan, harbors deep hatred for the Holy Roman Empire.  
He has inherited the warrior spirit of the Celts."  

"Give him a gemstone-infused lance and let him charge straight into the enemy ranks."  
Aidan would serve as the ‘Lancer.’  

"Gideon Levi, the mountain-born Jew, comes from a long line of priests.  
His leadership is unquestionable."  

"I observed him during the assemblies.  
He can make groups of people experience the same illusions simultaneously."  

"People dismiss him as just a ‘witch’s son,’ but they don’t understand his power."  

"With gemstone energy, he could induce battlefield-wide illusions."  

Schneider realized what Werner was suggesting.  
"You mean to use these illusions to lessen fear and pain?"  

"Exactly. If soldiers feel no fear or pain, they will fight with unwavering conviction."  

Gideon would become the army’s ‘Healer.’  

Now, Werner needed a long-range combatant.  

"To counter the knights’ cavalry charge, we need a skilled archer."  
"That would be Gerald."  

"Archery is all about timing and reading the battlefield."  

"Gerald may be the youngest, but he’s inherited a keen business acumen."  
"He can analyze people’s movements and plan ahead—an essential trait for an archer."  

Gerald would serve as the army’s ‘Archer.’  

Now for close-range combat—  

Schneider hesitated before suggesting, "What about Max?"  

"Yes, Max is perfect. His brute strength lets him swing a halberd effortlessly."  

"With a hooked blade, he can dismount knights and bring them down into the mud."  

Max would be the force’s ‘Halberdier.’  

"Max will also serve another role."  
"He will be Maria’s personal bodyguard—the ‘Guardian.’"  

"Maria must remain safe while managing the gemstone reserves."  

Werner then turned his attention to Maria’s father.  

"What was his name again? We always just call him ‘Maria’s father.’"  
"His name is Joseph Levi."  

"Good. Joseph doesn’t have the combat skills of the others, but he commands deep respect."  

"His motivation is stronger than anyone’s—his wife is a captive of the Holy Roman Empire."  

"He will coordinate the battle’s overall flow, acting as the ‘Joker’—an adaptable leader."  

Schneider carefully reviewed Werner’s notes.  

"This sounds promising, but we need extensive training.  
These warriors must work together seamlessly in the heat of battle."  

Under Schneider’s command, the elite warriors trained relentlessly.  

Maria, as the ‘Guardian,’ drew out gemstone energy.  
Henkel, as the ‘Linker,’ distributed the energy across the field.  
Gideon, as the ‘Healer,’ cast illusions to inspire courage.  
Aidan, as the ‘Lancer,’ led the charge.  
Gerald, as the ‘Archer,’ provided long-range support.  
Max, as the ‘Halberdier,’ neutralized enemy knights.  
Joseph, as the ‘Joker,’ adapted as needed.  

Their combat synergy improved drastically.  

By nightfall, their illusions became so real that enemy scouts reported seeing giant creatures alongside the Swiss forces.  

The Swiss army had transformed.  

Werner smiled.  

"All you need to do now—"  
"Is bring me Leopold I’s head."  

The autumn sky above Obwalden burned with anticipation.
