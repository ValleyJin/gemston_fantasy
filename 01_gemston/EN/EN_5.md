“The Empire needs power, Cesar.”

Leopold I of the House of Habsburg expressed his frustration to Cesar. <br>

“I understand.” <br>
Cesar poured wine into a crystal glass on the banquet table, offering it to Leopold. <br>

“Though we are based in a small Swiss village, <br>
I know well that Your Highness, Prince Leopold—legitimate scion of the noble Habsburg line—intends to unify the entire Empire.” <br>

Leopold was easily swayed by flattery. <br>
“You do get me. <br>
The West Franks have formed a unified empire and keep growing stronger, but here in East Francia, we remain divided. <br>
I can’t sleep at night.” <br>

As soon as the Emperor finished, Cesar slowly turned around. <br>

They already had enough power.

Amid the evening banquet set in the imperial courtyard, Cesar raised his wineglass, <br>
then walked over to the crates stacked near a poplar tree. <br>
In the darkness, Gemstones glowed, reflecting off his face. <br>

“Care to take a look?” <br>

Next to the Gemstone crate stood a young Celtic priestess, blindfolded, with her hands and feet bound to a post. <br>
Cesar fiddled with her Gemstone necklace, tore it off, and placed it on a blacksmith’s anvil. <br>

Her lips trembled like ripples in water. <br>

Amused, Cesar circled her, then suddenly drove a knife into her arm. <br>
A bright gush of blood spurted forth. <br>
At her shriek, the Gemstone pendant glowed crimson, <br>
slowly melting the steel anvil supporting it until rivulets of molten metal splattered. <br>

“If you want to live, fuel those flames,” Cesar whispered. <br>
She shook her head in terror, saying she knew nothing. <br>

<br><br><br>

Cesar picked up a torch from the banquet area and tossed it onto the firewood under the post where the priestess was bound. <br>
Sparks roared up, swallowing the logs. <br>

She howled as the flames engulfed her. <br>
The more she screamed, the hotter the Gemstone pendant on the anvil burned. <br>
In moments, the steel anvil was reduced to seething molten iron. <br>
Her body burned away to ash, leaving only the smell of molten metal and an eerie silence. <br>

“Sigh… The trouble is that we can’t properly extract this power. <br>
We can’t just keep burning priestesses to get it.” <br>

Cesar nudged the charred remains with his foot. <br>

<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>

He looked toward the sky. <br>

‘Our family has a long history of witch-hunting,’ <br>
he thought, finally sipping his wine. <br>

The Emperor gazed at him hopefully while sipping his own. <br>
“These days, Gemstones often glow on their own, you know. I sense them nearby.” <br>

The Emperor nodded. <br>
“You’re right. We’ve collected enough Gemstones over the years. <br>
All that remains is to find someone able to wield them.” <br>

“But how long will we harass these Celtic priestesses? <br>
From what I can tell, Celtic witches just use Gemstones for fortune-telling; they can’t fully unleash power.” <br>

At the Emperor’s lament, Cesar raised his glass again. <br>
“You recall that well-known Jewish jeweler we framed and exiled from Rome a few months ago? <br>
Rumor says that family’s women can use Gemstone power. I’m the one who set them up. Hahaha.” <br>

Grabbing a nearby torch, Cesar’s eyes glittered more intensely. <br>
“Once they’re in danger, they’ll have no choice but to call upon the Gemstone’s power. <br>
So I planted spies to watch them.” <br>
He paused, locking eyes with Leopold. <br>

“Right on cue, we received word from Grand Duke Cheringen. <br>
In the dead of night, they used Gemstones for lighting, <br>
and in Bern, after being exiled, they fought a local resident <br>
and beat a man twice their size with nothing but Gemstone force.” <br>

A spark lit the Emperor’s gaze. <br>
“So you exiled those Jewish folks for that reason? <br>
Quite clever, Cesar.” <br>

Cesar set out for Bern. <br>
“No need to bother Celtic priestesses anymore. I’ll confirm it myself.” <br>
