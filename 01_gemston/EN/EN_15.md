# 15. Cesar’s Scheme  
<br><br><br>

The Habsburg Palace in Aargau, Switzerland.<br>  

Although the family had risen to the throne of great European powers, including Austria, <br>  
Leopold remained bound to this small country, burdened by the recent uprisings in several cantons.<br>  

"A fool who cannot even unify Switzerland,"<br>  
he muttered to himself as he entered the palace.<br>  

As he arrived, his aides, who had been waiting, gathered to greet him.<br>  
"Lord Cesar, welcome back."<br>  

"I have finally identified the witch who can unlock the power of the Gemstone.<br>  
Keep a close watch on her. She will be useful as bait."<br>  

Inside the carriage, Maria’s mother was bound and blindfolded,<br>  
before being dragged away to the underground prison.<br>  

"But, Your Lordship, His Majesty already seems to be aware<br>  
that you stopped by the Papal Court before coming here."<br>  

Feigning indifference, Cesar flinched slightly.<br>  

He was about to head into the emperor’s office but changed course,<br>  
walking instead toward his quarters in the annex.<br>  

From afar, Tori came running.<br>  
"Oh, my sweet little pup."<br>  

Cesar stroked Tori’s thick, raccoon-like tail.<br>  

"You're the only one who calls Tori a dog, my lord. Ha ha."<br>  
"Well, he acts just like one. Ha ha ha."<br>  

After giving Tori a thorough rub and pulling him close to his chest,<br>  
Cesar walked through the corridor and entered his room.<br>  

Tori glanced around the room before speaking.<br>  
"Leopold… his movements… are suspicious…"<br>  

Tori's voice stuttered.<br>  
Something was wrong.<br>  

Cesar opened the back panel and replaced the Gemstone.<br>  
The old, depleted Gemstone was tossed out the window.<br>  

"Cesar, Cesar!"<br>  
"Now that I’ve replaced you with a fresh one, your voice is booming again. Ha ha ha."<br>  

Cesar meticulously checked Tori’s body,<br>  
proudly affirming his place as the finest automata maker in Europe.<br>  

A projection lit up the wall,<br>  
displaying the recordings that Tori had gathered while roaming the palace.<br>  

As Cesar listened to the briefing, his expression darkened.<br>  
"That cunning Leopold…"<br>  

Gripping his goblet, Cesar cursed under his breath.<br>  
"He’s been receiving reports in real time. There was a spy following me in Avignon!"<br>  

"Then he must suspect that I’m betraying him…"<br>  

Tori drew a dagger from his pouch.<br>  
"Whoa, whoa, Tori. Not now, ha ha ha."<br>  

For a while, Cesar stared into the crackling fire,<br>  
occasionally sipping his wine.<br>  

For a man who could never sleep in peace,<br>  
perhaps this was the closest thing to rest.<br>  

"For now, I'll pretend nothing has happened."<br>  

Fixing his attire, he stepped out into the hallway, heading toward Leopold’s office.<br>  

At that moment, the royal family members of the House of Habsburg<br>  
were passing through the corridors for the ongoing banquet,<br>  
greeting Cesar as they walked by.<br>  

Cesar’s distinguished looks and refined manners had already made him<br>  
a favorite among the young women and widows of the family.<br>  

"I had a lovely time playing with Tori.<br>  
Even though he’s an automaton, he’s incredible.<br>  
He understands every word as if there’s a real person inside!"<br>  

Princess Josephine was an audacious liar.<br>  

Cesar had just seen the footage in Tori’s report—<br>  
how she had kicked Tori and poured hot tea over him.<br>  

"Oh, well. I do enjoy making things.<br>  
That’s why I keep designing weapons for the unification of the Eastern Roman Empire."<br>  

Cesar pulled a telescope from his pocket and handed it to Josephine.<br>  

"Oh wow! This is truly amazing.<br>  
I can see mountains on the moon! I’ve never seen it this clearly before!"<br>  

Exchanging a few pleasantries,<br>  
Cesar sent Josephine on her way and resumed his walk toward Leopold’s office.<br>  

Just as he was about to enter, he met Leopold in the corridor.<br>  

"Oh! When did you return?"<br>  

Leopold dismissed Cesar’s formal greeting with a wave of his hand,<br>  
leading him into a private chamber.<br>  

"All the royal family members are gathered here,<br>  
but honestly, the royal treasury is tight,<br>  
and they want to avoid an all-out war if possible."<br>  

After listening to the situation, Cesar proposed a strategy—<br>  
to prevent any cantons outside the three main rebel states from joining the war.<br>  

His solution was to offer noble titles to the leaders of various Swiss regions<br>  
and cut their taxes and tributes in half.<br>  

"Would this actually work?"<br>  
"Watch and see.<br>  
These people aren’t looking for a war.<br>  
They’re just throwing a tantrum, demanding better treatment."<br>  

And indeed, Cesar was right.<br>  

As imperial envoys were dispatched to every Swiss canton with the emperor’s decree,<br>  
all except the three main rebel states declared their non-participation in the war.<br>  

.<br>  
.<br>  
.<br>  

Bern, too, received the emperor’s decree.<br>  
And now, the same decree had arrived in Obwalden.<br>  

The fervor of the independence war cooled in an instant.<br>  

"The other cantons have already declared their withdrawal,"<br>  

Commander Werner watched as the excitement among his men began to wane.<br>  

Even in Obwalden, soldiers started murmuring<br>  
that it might be wiser to accept the emperor’s offer.<br>  

"With just three cantons, we don’t stand a chance…"<br>  

General Werner confided his concerns to Maria and her father.<br>  

That wasn’t all.<br>  

Even within Obwalden, more soldiers were beginning to voice their doubts.<br>  
Some suggested they should accept the empire’s offer.<br>  

That night, Werner visited Mercenary Captain Schneider.<br>  

"The pilgrimage begins tomorrow, doesn’t it?"<br>  

Sensing something was wrong,  
Schneider simply nodded.<br>  

"Leave immediately."<br>  

"The decree states that our taxes will be completely abolished…<br>  
if we hand over Maria."<br>  

If they were to escape unnoticed,<br>  
they had to move under the cover of night.<br>  

They couldn’t bring too many mercenaries along.<br>  

With only a few carriages, drivers, and a small unit of guards,<br>  
they slipped away from Obwalden.<br>  

Inside the carriage, Maria clutched the Gemstone tightly,<br>  
whispering a silent prayer.<br>
