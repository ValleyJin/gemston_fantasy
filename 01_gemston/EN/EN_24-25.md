**November 18, 2031 – CERN Laboratory, Switzerland**  

Deep beneath the Franco-Swiss border, the underground research facility of CERN hummed with energy.  

Inside the control room, a group of scientists gathered around a set of monitors.  

"Doctor, are you sure about this?"  
"The energy levels have exceeded the safety threshold."  
"If anything goes wrong—"  

Dr. Levy adjusted his glasses and silenced his colleague with a glance.  
"Proceed with the experiment."  

With a final keystroke, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) activated.  

A deep vibration resonated through the underground tunnel as subatomic particles accelerated to near-light speed.  

The detectors registered an unusual energy signature.  

"Unbelievable… We’re seeing an anomaly that doesn’t match any known physical models."  

Suddenly, an alarm rang out.  

The energy readings **spiked beyond expected limits.**  

Then— **total darkness.**  

The entire underground facility lost power.  

Emergency red lights flickered on, casting eerie shadows on the walls.  

"What happened?! Restart the system—now!"  

Technicians scrambled to regain control, frantically inputting commands.  

Then, something **impossible** occurred.  

A floating **ring of light** formed in the accelerator chamber.  

It pulsed with an unfamiliar rhythm, as if responding to something unseen.  

One of the researchers whispered, "Is it… reacting to us?"  

Dr. Levy’s gaze remained fixed on the phenomenon.  
"This is no ordinary reaction."  

Within the luminous ring, **symbols that should not exist in this era** appeared.  

A sequence of **prime numbers** glowed within the structure.  

Then, without warning, the ring **collapsed inward**—vanishing into a single point.  

Silence followed.  

A scientist checked the atomic clock.  
Only a second had passed.  

But outside, the **stars had shifted position.**  

CERN’s midnight experiment had altered something far beyond their understanding.

# 25. The Templar Order <br>

**November 19, 2031 – A Hidden Chamber in Avignon**  

In the depths of an ancient crypt beneath Avignon, candlelight flickered against the stone walls.  

Twelve figures, clad in ceremonial robes, sat in a perfect circle.  

Engraved beneath their feet was the **seal of the Templar Order**—unchanged for centuries.  

"The Pope’s relics have been stolen."  
"The GemSTONE is no longer under Vatican control."  

Murmurs of concern filled the chamber.  

A high-ranking member stood.  
His voice carried across the room with solemn authority.  

"The resurrection of the **Red GemSTONE** changes everything."  
"If we do not act, it will fall into the wrong hands."  

One of the younger members spoke hesitantly.  
"But how did the Swiss obtain it?"  

A chuckle came from the shadows.  

"They were never meant to possess such power."  

"The Swiss Confederacy is playing with forces beyond their comprehension."  

The **Grand Master**, an elder draped in white and gold, finally spoke.  

"The existence of the GemSTONE **must not be revealed to the world.**"  

"If the ancient contract is broken, history will repeat itself."  

A heavy silence fell upon the chamber.  

Then, as one, the knights of the Templar Order **rose from their seats.**  

Their mission had begun.
