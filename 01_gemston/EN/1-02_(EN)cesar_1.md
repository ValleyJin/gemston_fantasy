'The Empire needs strength, Cesar'<br>

Leopold I of the Habsburg dynasty confides his frustrations to Cesar. <br>

"I understand." <br>
Cesar pours wine into a glass at the banquet hall and offers it to Duke Leopold. <br>

"Though I've settled in a small Swiss village, <br>
how could I not understand Your Highness Leopold's desire to oversee the entire empire as the legitimate heir of the noble House of Habsburg? <br>

Leopold is weak to flattery. <br>
"Indeed, you understand me well. <br>
While West Francia unifies and grows stronger as an empire, our East Francia remains divided. <br>
This keeps me awake at night." <br>

As the Emperor finishes speaking, Cesar slowly turns around. <br>

'We have plenty of power' <br>
