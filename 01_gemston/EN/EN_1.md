December 1, 2031, 8:13 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) <br>
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, <br>
Greenbelt, Maryland, MD 20771, USA <br>

Morning sunlight streams gently through the windows. <br>
Monitors all around display videos tracking the orbit of the asteroid probe Lucy. <br>

Inside the spacious control center, the Beatles’ Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds plays softly. <br>

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green <br>
Towering over your head <br>
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes <br>
And she's gone <br>
Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br>
Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br>
Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br>

diamonds <br>
diamonds... <br>
Its chorus repeats in a dreamlike echo. <br>
Nevertheless, Center Director Alan Kennedy can’t help but wake up. <br>

Bang. <br>
A burly man pushes open the door and, stumbling over some stacked supplies, knocks them down. <br>

“Good grief... Andrew.” <br>
Kennedy puts his glasses back on, glancing behind him. <br>
“Those items look a bit damaged—hope they weren’t expensive?” <br>
The big man, who nearly fell over but managed to regain his balance, smiles sheepishly. <br>
Unlike everyone else, he’s dressed in casual clothes. <br>
A badge around his neck identifies him as part of the aerospace startup De Morgan, Inc. <br>
Andrew Levi, an astrophysicist and CTO. <br>

“You stayed up all night again, didn’t you? It’s been a month of this.” <br>
He waves a plastic bag containing coffee and donuts in both hands. <br>
“You’ll ruin your health at this rate, Dr. Kennedy. Let’s get some breakfast!” <br>

“Living alone at your age, skipping meals—that’s a fast track to dementia. Haha.” <br>
Kennedy doesn’t even turn around; he simply points toward a seat a few rows ahead. <br>
“Oh? There’s an operator there too? I brought plenty of donuts—no worries.” <br>
A blonde operator is already fast asleep. <br>
Both of them look utterly exhausted. <br>

Andrew hands a donut and coffee to each of the two. <br>
Kennedy and the operator rub their eyes and start eating. <br>

“So, it’s been how many years since Lucy first launched, and now it’s back on track to Earth?” <br>
“It was launched toward Jupiter around the year you graduated, 2021, so nearly a decade ago.” <br>
“And instead of returning home, it’s pulled off course over there… Strange.” <br>
“That’s the Lagrange Point L4. We’ll reach it in half a day, so we’ll find out soon enough.” <br>
“That place is teeming with asteroids. Looks like our billion-dollar probe is about to become scrap.” <br>

Kennedy sighs, as though resigned, and takes a bite of his donut. <br>
He chews, swallows, then speaks into his headset. <br>
“Enlarge the predicted path and capture some images.” <br>

The operator activates Lucy’s L’LORRI camera. <br>
On the predicted path, there’s nothing but empty space and distant stars. <br>
Although, off that trajectory, you can vaguely see some large asteroids. <br>

“What exactly is it after? There’s nothing out there.” <br>
Kennedy continues to watch, baffled. <br>

“It could be something too small for the camera’s resolution.” <br>
Andrew offers gently. <br>

“C’mon, youngster, can’t you think of something more imaginative?” <br>
Kennedy counters with a hint of sarcasm. <br>

“Well...” <br>
Andrew pulls another donut from the bag <br>
and uses it to block the incoming sunlight through the window. <br>
Light slips through the donut hole, shining on Andrew’s face. <br>

“Maybe it’s a donut-shaped structure with a hole in the middle.” <br>
A moment of silence passes as everyone looks at him. <br>
“If that were the case, it’d be nearly impossible to distinguish from starlight behind it.” <br>

Kennedy suddenly spits out the donut he was chewing and flips on his headset. <br>
“Operator? L’LORRI is running, right? Widen the field of view a bit.” <br>
Several-kilometer-wide asteroids now fit in the same frame. <br>
“Can we also activate L’Ralph? Crank up the sensitivity and apply the infrared filter.” <br>
After a short wait, data arrives. <br>
“Okay. Overlay the thermal pattern on the original image.” <br>
Infrared heat patterns appear on top of the photo. <br>

“All right, time for a bit of hidden-picture fun.” <br>
Kennedy compares the original and filtered images on two monitors. <br>
“I might beat you to it, Doctor.” <br>
The operator uses AI to extract areas showing significant differences. <br>

“Hold on... Huh... What is that? Zoom in on Section 45 of the FOV.” <br>
As the view zooms in, a faint circular shape appears. <br>
“That’s awfully round.” <br>
Andrew murmurs, intrigued. <br>

“AI correction in progress.” <br>
The operator looks at the monitor. <br>

“Oh...” <br>
All three exhale in a low, astonished murmur, practically in unison. <br>

![Ring](../images/ch-0-01-ring.png)
<br><br><br>

It’s a gigantic ring. <br>
Kennedy removes his glasses and stares intently at the central monitor. <br>

“Who… are… you?” <br>
He can’t even close his gaping mouth. <br>

Data continues streaming in. <br>
Its diameter is about 1 km, <br>
with a thickness of around 100 meters, shaped like a thin donut. <br>
The temperature hovers near 30 Kelvin, <br>
indicating some faint heat source inside. <br>

“In other words, this is an artificial structure… That’s what we’re seeing.” <br>
Kennedy expresses amazement as he reads the analysis, line by line. <br>
The operator, similarly curious, asks, <br>
“Doctor, we’ve scanned that region before. How did we miss this?” <br>

Kennedy inputs additional data, testing one hypothesis after another. <br>
“Is Lucy still sending data in real time?” <br>
“Yes, I’m pulling all of it, including system logs. I’ll put them on the main monitor.” <br>

Most logs detail communications between Lucy and us here at Goddard. <br>
But in between are chunks of unfamiliar data. <br>
They begin erratically, then gradually learn our communication protocols, showing exchanges in and out. <br>

“Clever. It’s been studying how we talk.” <br>
Kennedy grins. <br>
“So after it figured out how we communicate, it enticed Lucy over to that ring.” <br>
Andrew checks the monitor. <br>
“Not brute force, but coaxing with words… This is a fun discovery. Haha.” <br>

After a moment’s pause, Andrew says, <br>
“Or perhaps it just wanted to know if we could talk to each other.” <br>
Kennedy halts, as though struck, and exhales. <br>
“Ah...” <br>

Andrew rushes to his seat and puts on a headset. <br>
“Operator, open Port 3 for me.” <br>
“Port 3 open. You’re linked to Lucy.” <br>

The main monitor in the center mirrors Andrew’s screen in real time. <br>
“What should we call this?” <br>
“Let’s just call it ‘the Ring’ for now.” <br>
Andrew pauses, then simply types a short greeting. <br>

“Hi, the Ring” <br>
From Earth to L4 and back again takes about 19 minutes round trip. <br>
Anxious anticipation fills the silence as they wait. <br>

“A...” <br>
“A...” <br>
Weak signals cause the monitor to flicker. It’s unclear if it’s just noise. <br>

“Operator, we’re getting a signal. Boost sensitivity and filter out the noise.” <br>
“On it.” <br>

“Ar...” <br>
Kennedy and Andrew’s eyes widen. <br>

“Are you talking to me?” <br>
Lucy’s comm log clearly shows the response. <br>

. <br>
. <br>
. <br>
. <br>

An extended silence. <br>
All three look at one another, speechless. <br>

“Operator, where exactly is that signal originating?” <br>
Kennedy asks, voice trembling. <br>
“It’s coming from the Ring. Lucy just picks it up and relays it to us.” <br>
The operator jumps up and points to the front monitor. <br>
“See the graph on Monitor 2?” <br>

As Lucy draws closer to the Ring, <br>
it sends back a deluge of structural and material data on the Ring. <br>
“It’s like the Ring is pulling Lucy in to show it off: ‘Look, I’m right here.’” <br>

Kennedy hurriedly calls Human Resources. <br>
“Tell everyone coming in to turn around and go home.” <br>
He then pulls out a walkie-talkie for Security. <br>
“Seal the control center. Not a soul in or out, got it?” <br>

Taking a deep breath, Kennedy makes another call. <br>
“What you said would happen… has happened. I need you here right away.” <br>

In less than an hour, two individuals in black suits enter. <br>
They introduce themselves as agents from the United States Director of National Intelligence, <br>
and proceed to erase the CCTV records. <br>

“Apart from you three, does anyone else know about this?” <br>
They double-check the monitors. <br>

“How about some coffee and donuts?” <br>
Andrew greets them warmly. <br>
They’re the ones who recommended him for the Lucy Return Project— <br>
a huge honor for a thirty-something scientist fairly new to the field. <br>

Without a word, the agents sit at the computer desk and bring up analysis screens. <br>
“Lucy isn’t the only one heading to the Ring.” <br>
“What???” <br>
“There's a faint energy signal originating from Earth. It’s also going to the Ring. <br>
We’ll show you the signal intercepted by the NSA.” <br>

Zooming in on the map, they arrive at a café in the old town of Bern. <br>
Street view shows a sign reading cafe Marta. <br>
“Huh… that place...” <br>
“Your family owns it, right? They’ve held the title for generations.” <br>
“Yes, it’s inherited by the eldest on condition it’s never sold. I recently became the owner.” <br>
“You haven’t seen the basement, have you?” <br>
“The basement? No...” <br>

One agent smirks, pulls a radiant jewel from his bag, and holds it out. <br>
“Take a look at this.” <br>
It glimmers with a deep blue light—less a reflection, more of an inner glow. <br>
“That café’s basement is cleverly hidden. <br>
You’d be astonished at the sheer volume of gemstones down there. <br>
When the NSA first picked up the signal, they thought it was some spy transmission, but they traced it here.” <br>

Returning the jewel to his bag, the agent continues: <br>
“We initially suspected the Ring would be at Lagrange Point L4.” <br>
“How did you know?” <br>
“Check out this image we found down in that basement.” <br>
He projects the picture onto the main monitor. <br>

![Gemstone](../images/ch-0-02-stigmata.png)

“Ah...” <br>
Everyone gasps in awe. <br>

“That’s a portrait of Maria Levi, an ancestor of yours. <br>
Imagine her face as the Sun. <br>
Her hands are precisely at the Lagrange Points. <br>
In her palms, there’s a ring drawn. <br>
And if you’re looking at the painting, you’re positioned where Earth would be.” <br>

![Gemstone](../images/ch-0-01-Lagrangian_point.webp)

Silence reigns for a moment. <br>

“In the basement of cafe Marta, there are countless volumes chronicling these legends. <br>
They’re no mere myths now, but proven realities.” <br>

“All right, Dr. Levi, please come with us. <br>
We’ve prepared a project for you to lead.” <br>
The agents hurry him along, packing documents and bags, then waiting at the door. <br>

Kennedy can’t close his mouth, struck speechless. <br>
Andrew, initially taken aback, calmly gathers his belongings. <br>
He looks up at the central monitor, which still displays his grandmother Maria’s portrait. <br>

He glances at the donut-shaped stigmata in each of her hands, <br>
then at the Ring on the monitor beside it. <br>

Steeling himself, Andrew steps toward the door with the agents. <br>

“Lucy is about to reach the Ring. Initiating reverse thrust.” <br>
The operator reports. <br>

Lucy’s reverse-thrust system fires. <br>
They pause to watch the monitor. <br>

“Wait...? The Ring’s center is lighting up!!!” <br>
The operator’s voice quivers with alarm. <br>

Though the Ring is shaped with an empty center, <br>
red flames begin to flicker at that midpoint, <br>
then rapidly condense into a massive sphere of blue light. <br>

“My God… The Ring must be interpreting Lucy’s reverse thrust as a hostile act. <br>
It’s going to destroy Lucy. Stop the reverse thrust, now!” <br>
Andrew shouts, but it’s too late. <br>

A brilliant flash floods the screen, <br>
followed by a deafening roar, and every monitor abruptly goes dark. <br>
