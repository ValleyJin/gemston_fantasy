# 36. The Queen’s Return <br>
<br><br><br>

**March 29, 1315**  
**Early Morning**  

"The **Pope is in critical condition!**  

Quick, call **Father Gregory!**"  

Maria, who had **been watching over the Pope all night,**  
shouted down from the **tower window.**  

The Pope **gasped for breath.**  

His **half-closed eyes**  
reflected the dim candlelight.  

Maria, **her eyes brimming with tears,**  
gently held his **withered hands.**  

With a faint tremble,  
he pressed a **small iron key**  
into Maria’s palm.  

"The GemSTONEs here…  
they belong **to you now…**"  

His voice was barely a whisper.  

Maria could not speak.  

She simply **clasped his fragile hands**  
between her own,  
scarred from burns.  

Her fingers trembled,  
but she said **nothing.**  

Through the long hours of the night,  
Tori had stayed beside her,  
his **glowing eyes unwavering.**  

.  
.  
.  

**WAAAAHHH!!!**  

A **thunderous roar** erupted  
as the **Templar Order**  
crossed the **Rhône River**  
and set up their battle formations.  

From the **tower window,**  
Commander Werner and Gerald  
watched in grim silence.  

The enemy force was **easily 2,000 strong.**  

"What **kind of promise** did Cesar make  
to bring together these **greedy knights** like this?"  

Werner **rubbed his eyes** in disbelief.  

The **Templar vanguard**  
had already begun moving  
across the **narrow bridge**  
connecting the **Rhône** to the Papal Palace.  

"They're testing our defenses,"  
Gerald muttered.  

His **archers** swiftly climbed  
to the **hills behind the palace,**  
securing the **high ground.**  

He **drew his longbow**  
and let an **arrow fly.**  

But it lacked the power  
he once commanded  
with the **GemSTONE’s energy.**  

The **arrows fell short.**  

Only Gerald’s shots  
managed to reach the bridge.  

Meanwhile,  
the **Templars,**  
empowered by **Cesar’s Red GemSTONEs,**  
**launched a devastating counterattack.**  

Their arrows struck with **relentless force,**  
and Gerald’s men  
fell **one after another.**  

"Damn it…  

They are **battle-hardened Crusaders.**  

And now,  
with the **GemSTONE’s power,**  
we **cannot stop them.**"  

With casualties mounting,  
Gerald ordered a **full retreat**  
back into the **palace.**  

.  
.  
.  

Cesar **stood atop**  
a carriage laden  
with **glowing Red GemSTONEs**  
on the far bank of the Rhône.  

Since his **many deaths and revivals,**  
he had gained absolute control  
over **at least the Red GemSTONEs.**  

Despite the **torrential rain,**  
he remained **dry.**  

Not a single drop touched him.  

The **energy of the GemSTONEs**  
repelled every raindrop  
before it could land.  

Confident in **his victory,**  
he unfastened his **gold-embroidered imperial cloak**  
and let it fall.  

His **lieutenant caught it**  
and draped it carefully  
over Cesar’s **black warhorse.**  

Now unburdened,  
Cesar **propelled himself into the air.**  

His **palms crackled**  
with the **red energy of the GemSTONEs.**  

He hovered **above the Rhône,**  
his **burning eyes** locked onto  
the **tower window of the Papal Palace.**  

Inside, he saw **the Pope,**  
his breath shallow,  
Maria standing at his side,  
and **Tori, unmoving.**  

Cesar **extended his hand.**  

A **red beam of energy**  
shot from his palm,  
grasping **Tori.**  

Tori’s **eyes flickered red,**  
and without resistance,  
he was **pulled into the sky**  
toward Cesar.  

"Tori!"  

Maria reached for him,  
but **he was already out of reach.**  

Cesar plucked the **blue GemSTONE**  
from Tori’s chest  
and replaced it  
with a **Red GemSTONE.**  

A low hum resonated  
as Tori’s system **recalibrated.**  

Now, he was **once again Cesar’s servant.**  

Then—  

**CRACK.**  

Like an **ancient oak splitting in half,**  
the **gates of Avignon**  
**were torn from their hinges.**  

The **Templar vanguard** stormed inside.  

.  
.  
.  

Max’s **Halberd Unit**  
charged forward through the rain,  
clashing with **Cesar’s warriors.**  

But the **Templars,**  
wielding **blazing red weapons,**  
cut through them  
**like falling leaves.**  

They **pushed through**  
with unstoppable force,  
rushing toward  
the **vaults of the Papal Palace.**  

Max collapsed,  
his **arm severed,**  
blood pooling around him.  

"Max!!!"  

Joseph, Maria’s father,  
screamed in **despair.**  

But before he could reach him,  
the **Templars swarmed forward,**  
and Max was lost in the chaos.  

His **eyes closed.**  

.  
.  
.  

The **vaults**  
were filled with **Templar soldiers.**  

The **massive hoard of GemSTONEs**  
had already been loaded  
onto **wagons.**  

They had seized **ancient texts,**  
**priceless paintings,**  
**gold and silver coins,**  
even the **Pope’s cherished wine.**  

Some bottles crashed to the floor,  
spilling **deep crimson puddles**  
like **blood.**  

With the vaults **secured,**  
only one target remained—  

**The Pope himself.**  

"To the tower!!!"  

The Templars,  
no longer knights  
but a **horde of marauders,**  
rushed **upward.**  

.  
.  
.  

Maria could hear them  
**charging up the stairs.**  

**BAM. BAM. BAM.**  

The Pope,  
his eyes filled with sorrow,  
turned to Maria.  

"Maria…  
I must confess…  
**before it is too late.**"  

Maria **nodded silently.**  

She could not speak.  

She could only **weep.**  

The Pope began his confession  
**in Latin.**  

He had **abandoned Rome,**  
bowing to the **threats of Philip IV.**  

He had sought **power,**  
but now he realized—  
**it had all been in vain.**  

Tears streamed down his face.  

"Maria…  

Sometimes,  
**even a mere trace**  
can **bring forth a miracle.**"  

With a final,  
**peaceful smile,**  
he exhaled his last breath.  

.  
.  
.  

Maria gently  
folded his hands  
over his chest.  

Then—  

She saw it.  

**Blood.**  

She slowly  
**unfolded his fingers.**  

There,  
on his **palm,**  
was the **stigmata.**  

Her breath **caught.**  

Trembling,  
she looked at her own hands.  

A **mark** had appeared.  

A **perfect circle,**  
pierced through the center.  

"Ah…"  

Maria lifted her gaze  
to the **heavens.**  

.  
.  
.  

The **storm howled.**  

The wind tore  
**through the battlefield.**  

Then,  
**suddenly,**  
it all **stopped.**  

A **single moment** of silence.  

One…  

Two…  

Then—  

**BOOM.**  

# 36. The Queen’s Return <br>
<br><br><br>

At that moment, a **blinding bolt of lightning**  
descended from the heavens.  

**ZZZZT…**  

A deafening crack echoed  
as metal **melted in an instant,**  
turning **to liquid, then gas,**  
before **vanishing entirely.**  

Suspended above the Rhône,  
Cesar **was struck.**  

His body **dissolved** in an instant,  
leaving behind only  
**a few scattered fragments**  
that tumbled **into the river below.**  

No blood.  

Not even water.  

Only a **strange, unidentifiable substance**  
that seeped into the currents.  

Across the river,  
in the **Templar camp,**  
Cesar’s **Red GemSTONE carriages**  
began **to explode, one by one.**  

The **shocking blasts**  
ripped through the air,  
so powerful  
that they made ears ring  
and **sent horses fleeing in terror.**  

Weapons, armor—  
everything heavy  
was discarded.  

The **Templars scattered,**  
running **barefoot**  
in a desperate retreat.  

**"WAAAH!!!"**  

A triumphant roar erupted  
from the **GemSTON Knights.**  

Their power  
**had returned.**  

The **pendants** around their necks  
and the **GemSTONE-embedded weapons**  
once again radiated  
**unstoppable force.**  

Glowing **blue light**  
surged through them.  

The Knights counterattacked.  

The **Templars’ vanguard,**  
now weakened and leaderless,  
fell **like autumn leaves in the wind,**  
scattering in retreat  
from the Papal Palace.  

Keith, the **Templar commander,**  
was the first to **flee.**  

On the only **bridge**  
crossing the Rhône,  
he **spurred his horse,**  
leaving his men behind.  

.  
.  
.  

"For my **beloved brother, Johan…  
This is for you."  

Gerald drew back his bowstring.  

Three arrows,  
**glowing with blue fire,**  
nestled in his grip.  

He released them.  

Keith’s **screams**  
were drowned  
by the **whistling air.**  

The first arrow **pierced his throat.**  

The second, his **back.**  

The third,  
**his lower spine.**  

He **toppled** from his horse,  
dead before he hit the ground.  

"Let none of them escape!"  

Henkel roared,  
galloping ahead  
on the **fastest horse,**  
overtaking the fleeing Templars.  

His **GemSTONE**  
acted as a conduit,  
amplifying its energy  
and **feeding it**  
to the Knights around him.  

Even far from the **Papal Palace,**  
the **power of the GemSTONEs**  
remained strong.  

Aidan followed close behind.  

His **lance,**  
tipped with **brilliant light,**  
cut through the **Templar formation.**  

Their **ranks shattered.**  

Some fell from their horses,  
others **trampled** their own allies  
in the chaos.  

.  
.  
.  

Seeing the **enemy collapse,**  
Maria’s father, Joseph,  
seized his **halberd.**  

He spun it like a **whirling blade.**  

The weapon  
once belonged to **Max.**  

Joseph fought  
with **vengeance in his heart.**  

The remaining **Templars,**  
disorganized and panicked,  
turned back—  

And saw it.  

A **massive dragon**  
**unleashing a torrent of fire.**  

It was Gideon’s **illusion.**  

But to the **Templars,**  
it was **real.**  

The flames  
**burned their flesh,**  
**exposed their bones.**  

Their **screams**  
echoed through the battlefield.  

Madness consumed them.  

They ran blindly,  
**losing all reason.**  

This was why,  
even years later,  
**none of them could remember  
what truly happened in Avignon.**  

.  
.  
.  

The **fields of Avignon**  
were now a **graveyard of battle.**  

Amidst the wreckage,  
Maria **descended**  
from the tower’s heights.  

Father Gregory,  
who had **witnessed it all,**  
fell to his knees.  

"You…  

Are you…  
the **Holy Mother reborn?**"  

Maria shook her head.  

"No, Father.  

I am **not.**"  

Her voice was calm.  

"But I can **feel it.**  

They…  

They have **arrived.**"  

She lifted a **finger,**  
pointing toward the **horizon.**  

Gregory turned  
and gasped.  

There, before them,  
the **fabric of reality itself wavered.**  

An image,  
**vast and surreal,**  
stretched across the sky—  

A **vision of space,**  
just beyond Earth’s atmosphere.  

Father Gregory,  
well-versed in **astronomy,**  
recognized it instantly.  

A **colossal ring**  
had **arrived.**  

It **rotated violently**  
as it began to **slow.**  

Jagged **spires**  
protruding from its edges  
caught **blinding beams of light**  
from the **galactic core.**  

One by one,  
the **spires folded inward.**  

One by one,  
their lights **faded.**  

Until—  

Darkness.  

.  
.  
.  

A sudden gust  
**tore through the battlefield.**  

The **winter storm**  
returned in full force,  
erasing the vision  
in a curtain of rain.  

Gregory trembled.  

What he had seen  
filled him with **both awe and dread.**  

He whispered the sight  
again and again,  
desperate not to forget.  

Then,  
he turned to Maria—  

Her small body,  
**shivering** in the cold.  

Gently,  
he wrapped his arms around her.
