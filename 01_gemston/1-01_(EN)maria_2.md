"My little one" <br>

Her tone suggested she already knew Maria would come. <br>
Grandmother had been waiting with a light on. <br>
But it wasn't a candle. <br>

"My necklace has been glowing since early evening." <br>
Grandmother removed her necklace and placed it around Maria's neck. <br>
"I knew this day would come, but I've never seen it glow this brightly before." <br>

It was a silver necklace. <br>
Though the chain's decorations were rough, it held a large bluish-green gemstone pendant, <br>
and remarkably, it was emitting light that illuminated the dark room. <br>

"I was going to pass it down when I had a daughter, but strangely, your mother never showed the ability, so I kept it." <br>
"What?" <br>

Maria's large eyes sparkled, reflecting the gemstone's light. <br>

"Your father's memory of that day must still be vivid." <br>
Grandmother's voice grew distant, as if recalling an old tale. <br>

"It was the day your father first came to our village as a traveling merchant. <br>
He was selling candles to the miners. <br>
Back then, the mines were our village's lifeblood." <br>

Maria listened intently, though she'd heard this story countless times before. <br>

"That day, Max, who had the candle monopoly in our village, <br>
confronted your father with his gang. <br>
They were ready to use force to drive him out." <br>

Grandmother's eyes sparkled with pride as she continued. <br>

"But your father didn't back down. <br>
Instead, he pulled out a gemstone from his pocket. <br>
The stone began to glow, casting light brighter than any candle. <br>
The villagers were amazed." <br>

Maria remembered her father telling her how that moment changed everything. <br>
The villagers, who had been hostile moments before, suddenly became potential customers. <br>
Even Max, who had threatened him earlier, ended up becoming his closest friend. <br>

"Your father's gemstones revolutionized mining in our village. <br>
They were safer than candles, lasted longer, and lit up the darkest corners of the mines." <br>

Grandmother paused, her expression growing serious. <br>

"But Maria, remember this: <br>
The true power of these stones isn't in their light alone. <br>
It's in how they respond to those who carry our bloodline." <br>
