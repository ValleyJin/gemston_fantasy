"Dear Peter, <br>
This old man arrived in Bern earlier this month, <br>
and I've been looking around here and there. <br>

Abigail and her group have departed from Australia, <br>
so let's meet tomorrow evening at Cafe Marta as planned. <br>

Make sure to bring the GemSTON sample. <br>
After all, our family donated it, so what harm could come from borrowing it briefly?" <br>

"Grandfather. Even though you explained it over the phone, we still can't believe it." <br>
Peter spoke curtly. <br>
"These were just bedtime stories we heard as children. How could they be real? We're not kids anymore." <br>

Abigail's large eyes darted from Peter to Dr. Levy, amused. <br>
She stifled a laugh and rested her chin on one hand. <br>
But the other grandchildren surprisingly kept their gaze fixed on Grandfather Levy's lips. <br>

"Oh... what's this? Everyone's so focused?" <br>
As Abigail looked around incredulously, Christian, the eldest grandson, spoke up. <br>
"I've always wanted to ask about this. Though our family has been in the jewelry business for generations, sometimes the legends about the gems felt real." <br>

"Of course they're real." <br>
The frothy beer slid down Dr. Levy's throat. <br>

"Everything began here in Bern. These gems that only responded to the women in our family." <br>
Dr. Levy caressed the gemstone. <br>
Its self-luminescent light flickered, casting a gentle glow on the faint smile of Dr. Levy, now over 70. <br>

Looking up at the old painting on the wall, he quietly began to speak. <br>
Though for the grandchildren it was a familiar legend they'd heard hundreds of times, <br>
in Bern's crisp night air, anything seemed possible. <br>
