![Ring](/01_gemston/images/ch-0-01-control_center.png)

December 1, 2031, 8:13 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) <br>
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), <br>
Greenbelt, Maryland, MD 20771, USA <br>

Morning sunlight shone through the windows. <br>
Throughout the control center, every monitor displayed live feeds tracking the orbit of the asteroid probe Lucy. <br>

In that wide operations room, The Beatles’ “Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds” played softly. <br>

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green <br>
Towering over your head <br>
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes <br>
And she's gone <br>
Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br>
Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br>
Lucy in the sky with diamonds <br>

diamonds <br>
diamonds... <br>
The chorus echoed as if in a dream, <br>
yet Dr. Alan Kennedy, the center director, had no choice but to wake up. <br>

Thud. <br>
A large man barged in, pushing the door and toppling stacks of supplies. <br>

“Darn it… Andrew.” <br>
Kennedy put his glasses back on, glancing behind him. <br>
“Some of this equipment looks fragile. Hope it isn’t expensive?” <br>
Nearly losing his balance, the big man managed to straighten up with an embarrassed grin. <br>
Unlike the others, he wore casual clothes. <br>
A badge around his neck read De Morgan, Inc., an aerospace startup. <br>
He was Dr. Andrew Levi, astrophysicist, CTO.

“You’ve been up all night again, haven’t you? It’s been a month now,” <br>
he said, waving a plastic bag holding coffee and donuts. <br>
“If you keep skipping breakfast, you’ll make yourself ill, Dr. Kennedy. Let’s take a break!” <br>

“A single old bachelor skipping meals… surest path to early dementia, haha.” <br>
Kennedy ignored him, merely pointing a finger at the row of seats up front. <br>
“Oh? We have an operator here too? Don’t worry, I brought plenty of donuts.” <br>
The blonde operator was already slumped over, sound asleep. <br>
Both looked utterly worn out. <br>

Andrew handed a donut and coffee to the two. <br>
Kennedy and the operator rubbed their eyes while they ate. <br>

“So, how many years had it been since Lucy was launched? Now it’s finally coming back to Earth?” <br>
“It was fired off toward Jupiter in 2021—the year you graduated—so nearly a decade. <br>
But it’s now getting pulled off over there…” <br>
“Lagrange Point L4, half a day’s journey. We’ll find out soon enough.” <br>
“That region’s jammed with asteroids. Looks like we’ve wasted a billion dollars on that probe.” <br>

Kennedy, resigned, took a bite of donut. <br>
He chewed, then spoke into his headset. <br>
“Magnify the predicted path and start filming.” <br>

The operator powered up Lucy’s L’LORRI camera. <br>
But the projected route showed little more than empty space and shimmering stars. <br>
Off to the side, you could see some large asteroids, but that was it. <br>

“What’s it aiming for? There’s nothing out there,” <br>
Kennedy muttered, perplexed. <br>

“It might be something smaller than the camera’s resolution,” <br>
Andrew offered. <br>

“Kid, can’t you be more creative?” <br>
Kennedy retorted drily. <br>

“Well…” <br>
Andrew took another donut from the bag, <br>
using it to block a shaft of sunlight from the window. <br>
A faint glow passed through the donut hole, shining on Andrew’s face. <br>

“Or maybe it’s donut-shaped, a big hole in the center.” <br>
For a moment, everyone fell silent, staring at him. <br>
“In that case, from a distance, it’d blend right into the starfield.” <br>

Kennedy almost choked on his donut, then activated his headset. <br>
“Operator. L’LORRI’s running, yeah? Try widening the field of view.” <br>
Asteroids a few kilometers across now fitted in one screen. <br>
“Let’s also bring L’Ralph online. Crank up sensitivity, use the infrared filter.” <br>
After some waiting, data arrived. <br>
“Okay, overlay that thermal data onto the image.” <br>
Infrared patterns flickered over the photograph. <br>

“All right, let’s see what’s hiding,” <br>
Kennedy said, checking two different monitors. <br>
“I can do that faster, Doctor,” <br>
the operator teased, letting AI pick out suspicious differences. <br>

“Wait, hold on… That’s suspicious. Zoom in on FOV section 45.” <br>
The image scaled up, revealing a faint circular shape. <br>
“That’s too perfect,” <br>
Andrew mumbled in fascination. <br>

“AI corrections coming through.” <br>
The operator watched the monitor. <br>

“Wow…” <br>
All three uttered a single, heavy exhale of awe. <br>

![Ring](../images/ch-0-01-ring.png)
<br><br><br>

They were seeing a massive ring. <br>
Kennedy slipped off his glasses, peering at the central screen. <br>

“Who… are you?” <br>
He couldn’t shut his gaping mouth. <br>

Data kept streaming. <br>
It measured about a kilometer across, <br>
with a thickness of 100 meters, resembling a slender donut. <br>
The temperature was some 30 Kelvin, <br>
suggesting a faint heat source inside. <br>

“So basically, it’s man-made… Right?” <br>
Reading line after line, Kennedy breathed in amazement. <br>
The operator also grew curious. <br>
“Doctor, we scanned that zone plenty of times before. Why did we just skip over it?” <br>

Kennedy typed in various checks, testing a hypothesis. <br>
“Is Lucy still sending a steady stream of data?” <br>
“Yes, we’re pulling system data now. I’ll put it on the main screen.” <br>

Most lines showed Lucy’s communication logs with Goddard, <br>
but here and there lurked unknown signals. <br>
Initially random, they gradually fell in line with our comm protocols, leaving a record of data in/out. <br>

“Look at this one. It studied how we talk,” <br>
Kennedy said with a sly grin. <br>
“It learned the comm protocol, then coaxed Lucy over there.” <br>
Andrew peered at the screen. <br>
“It didn’t use force but enticed us with words? Fun times, haha.” <br>

After a small pause, Andrew said, <br>
“Then again, maybe it wanted to see if we were able to talk back.” <br>
Kennedy froze, letting out a soft gasp. <br>
“Ah…” <br>

Suddenly, Andrew rushed to his own console, switching his headset on. <br>
“Operator, open port 3 for me.” <br>
“Port 3 is open. Lucy’s signal is linked.” <br>

On the main screen, everyone saw Andrew’s interface. <br>
“Wait, what do we even call that object?” <br>
“Let’s just call it The Ring,” <br>
Kennedy said. Andrew typed a brief greeting. <br>

“Hi, The Ring.” <br>
It took about 19 minutes for signals to go to L4 and back. <br>
They waited tensely. <br>

“A…” <br>
“A…” <br>
It was faint, hardly visible. They wondered if it was noise. <br>

“Operator, that’s a signal. Increase gain, filter noise,” <br>
Andrew instructed. <br>
“Yes, sir.” <br>

“Ar…” <br>
Kennedy and Andrew’s eyes widened. <br>

“Are you talking to me?” <br>
The Lucy comm logs displayed a crystal-clear response. <br>

. <br>
. <br>
. <br>
. <br>

They looked at each other without saying a word. <br>

“Operator,” said Kennedy, voice trembling, “where’s that coming from?” <br>
“From The Ring itself. Lucy’s only passing it along,” <br>
the operator answered, standing and pointing to the front monitor. <br>
“See that graph on monitor two?” <br>

As Lucy neared The Ring, <br>
it transmitted mass amounts of data on The Ring’s shape and materials. <br>
“It’s practically telling Lucy, ‘Here I am, come see me.’” <br>

Kennedy made a quick call to HR. <br>
“Anyone commuting in right now, send them home.” <br>
Then he got on the radio to security. <br>
“Lock down the control center. Nobody enters or leaves, not even an ant.” <br>

Taking a deep breath, Kennedy called another number. <br>
“That thing you talked about… It just happened. I need you here immediately.” <br>

Less than an hour later, two men in sharp black suits arrived, <br>
introduced themselves as DNI agents, <br>
and proceeded to erase the CCTV logs. <br>

“Are we sure nobody else knows, besides you three?” <br>
They glanced at the monitors again. <br>

“Coffee and donuts, anyone?” <br>
Andrew greeted them cheerfully. <br>
They were the ones who had recommended him to manage Lucy’s return. <br>
A big project for a novice astrophysicist in his thirties. <br>

They said nothing, just sat at the computer desk, pulling up analysis screens. <br>
“Lucy isn’t the only thing going to that Ring,” one agent remarked. <br>
“Huh??” <br>
“A small signal from Earth is heading there too. <br>
We caught it at NSA. Look at this.” <br>

They zoomed in on a map, landing on Bern’s old town. <br>
Street view showed cafe Marta. <br>
“Wait… that’s my…” <br>
“Your property, yes. Your family’s owned it for generations.” <br>
“Right, it’s passed down to each eldest child, never to be sold. I inherited it recently.” <br>
“The basement—have you been there?” <br>
“Basement? No…” <br>

Exchanging a look, one agent took a glowing gemstone from his briefcase. <br>
“Check this out.” <br>
It shimmered with a deep blue hue, not just reflection but actual glow. <br>
“The basement at cafe Marta is cleverly hidden. <br>
You’d be shocked at how many Gemstones are stashed down there, <br>
sending a faint trickle of energy to The Ring. <br>
At first, NSA thought it was a spy signal, but we traced it.” <br>

Returning the Gemstone to his bag, the agent continued, <br>
“We had suspected from the start that a ring might exist out at L4.” <br>
“How’d you figure that?” <br>
“Look at this painting we found in that basement.” <br>
He flashed the image on the center monitor. <br>

![Gemstone](../images/ch-0-02-stigmata.png)

“Ah…” <br>
All three gasped. <br>

“A portrait of your ancestor, Maria Levi. <br>
If her face is the Sun, <br>
her two palms align with the Lagrange Points. <br>
Each palm depicts a ring. <br>
So from your perspective, you’d be Earth.” <br>

![Gemstone](../images/ch-0-01-Lagrangian_point.webp)

A long silence followed. <br>

“In cafe Marta’s basement, there are countless volumes on these traditions. <br>
They’re not myths now. They’re real.” <br>

“Dr. Levi, please come with us,” one agent said. <br>
“We’ve got a project that needs you at the helm.” <br>
They grabbed their files and stood by the exit. <br>

Kennedy looked stunned beyond words. <br>
Andrew was rattled but soon began calmly gathering his stuff. <br>
He took one last look at the central monitor, featuring a portrait of Grandmother Maria. <br>

Her donut-shaped stigmata on both palms, <br>
and on the adjacent monitor, that mysterious Ring. <br>

Resolute, Andrew followed the agents outside. <br>

“Lucy’s about to reach The Ring. We’re engaging reverse thrust,” <br>
the operator reported. <br>

Everyone paused, staring at the monitor. Lucy’s reverse thrusters fired. <br>

“Huh…? The Ring’s center is starting to glow!” <br>
the operator shouted, voice rising. <br>

The Ring, hollow in the middle, now showed scattered bursts of red flame at its core, <br>
soon coalescing into a large blue mass of swirling energy. <br>

“Oh no… The Ring must be interpreting Lucy’s deceleration as aggression. <br>
It’s going to destroy Lucy—shut off the reverse thrust!” <br>
Andrew yelled, but it was too late. <br>

A blinding flash filled every screen, <br>
followed by a thunderous explosion, and all monitors went dark. <br>
