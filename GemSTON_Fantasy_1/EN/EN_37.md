# 37. Unstaking <br>
<br><br><br>

Everyone was busy preparing  
for the **funeral of Pope Clement V.**  

Yet, in the midst of it all,  
**Father Gregory** took a brief moment  
to step away **into the courtyard**  
of the **Papal Palace of Avignon.**  

There was **another funeral to hold.**  

Max's.  

With **deep devotion,**  
Father Gregory knelt beside the grave  
and prayed:  

**"In paradisum deducant te Angeli:  
in tuo adventu suscipiant te martyres,  
et perducant te in civitatem sanctam Ierusalem."**  

(*May the angels lead you into paradise;  
may the martyrs receive you at your arrival  
and bring you into the holy city of Jerusalem.*)  

As he finished,  
he turned to the gathered mourners  
with sorrowful eyes  
and spoke:  

"Max was a **good friend** to us all.  

Like Christ, who **gave His life for us,**  
Max **laid down his own life**  
**for his friends.**"  

Joseph, Maria’s father,  
clutched Max’s **coffin,**  
his **cries echoing**  
through the courtyard.  

.  
.  
.  

In the cemetery  
on the **grounds of the Papal Palace,**  
a new grave **stood among the old.**  

A **simple wooden cross**  
marked Max’s final resting place.  

One by one,  
they **laid their hands**  
upon the cross,  
whispering silent prayers  
for his **soul.**  

The **warm spring air of Avignon**  
carried the scent of new blossoms.  

The world, it seemed,  
was already **healing.**  

.  
.  
.  

"Come now,  
we must return,"  
Commander Werner called out.  

"Wait, Werner."  

Father Gregory **hurried back**  
to his chambers,  
returning with **a painting.**  

It depicted **Maria**  
gazing straight ahead,  
her **palms turned outward**  
to reveal the **stigmata.**  

The composition formed  
a perfect **equilateral triangle**—  

Maria’s **hands,**  
her **face,**  
and the **viewer’s own gaze.**  

The image seemed  
to **whisper a message**  
to those who beheld it.  

"Maria,"  
Father Gregory said gently,  
"Every event holds **God’s will.**  
We must **never forget.**  

Even when the years pass,  
someone must always **remember.**  

So I captured it  
**in this painting.**"  

Maria blushed,  
seeing herself **painted like a saint.**  

She **nodded,**  
promising to **preserve** the painting  
for generations to come.  

.  
.  
.  

"Gerald!"  

Maria turned to him.  

"The **Metal Armor** belongs to you.  
Keep it safe **within your family.**"  

"Wouldn’t it be **safer with you?**"  

Maria hesitated.  

"Yesterday,  
for the first time,  
I **understood**  
where the power of the GemSTONE  
**truly comes from.**  

And…  
it **terrifies me.**  

I think it’s best  
if the **GemSTONEs**  
stay with my family,  

but the **Metal Armor…**  
should remain with yours."  

Gerald gave a knowing smile.  

"To ensure that **no one**  
can **use this power freely.**"  

Maria **smiled back**  
and nodded.  

.  
.  
.  

Several wagons **stood ready,**  
loaded with the **GemSTONEs**  
that the Pope **had entrusted** to them.  

With heavy hearts,  
they began **the long journey home**  
to **Switzerland.**  

From the **tower of Avignon,**  
Father Gregory  
stood **waving endlessly**  
until they disappeared  
**beyond the horizon.**  

.  
.  
.  

As they traveled **through the fields,**  
they saw the remnants  
of **the battlefield.**  

**Helmets,**  
**broken swords,**  
**horses slain by the flash of light.**  

Corpses of **Templars,**  
trampled underfoot  
by their own panicked brethren.  

Maria sighed.  

"This war is finally over…  
but **at what cost?**"  

.  
.  
.  

"Maria,"  
Gerald called,  
dismounting from his horse.  

"Take a guess…  
**what do you think this is?**"  

Maria looked down.  

A **gold-embroidered red cloak**  
lay in the mud.  

She **recognized it immediately.**  

"Cesar’s **cloak.**  

Like his **greed,**  
it will not **rot**  
even after a thousand years."  

Gerald scoffed.  

"He watched the battle  
from his **imperial throne,**  
wrapped in **this very cloak.**  

If not for his **arrogance,**  
he would have been  
**far more dangerous.**"  

.  
.  
.  

Back in **Bern,**  
there was still **much work to do.**  

The **loaned GemSTONEs**  
needed to be retrieved  
from the **three Swiss cantons.**  

The **gold held as collateral**  
needed to be returned.  

And there was **one final task.**  

The **GemSTONEs**  
needed a **new home.**  

.  
.  
.  

"We **cannot** keep them  
out in the open,"  
Gerald said.  

The **GemSTONEs from Avignon,**  
those **seized from Cesar,**  
and the **ones belonging to Maria’s family**—  

All of them  
needed to be **hidden.**  

Maria pointed **to the ground.**  

"Here.  
**Under Bern.**"  

Gerald frowned.  

"Why here?"  

Maria **gazed at the sky.**  

"Because," she whispered,  
"there will be **no more wars** here."  

.  
.  
.  

Gerald unfurled a **blueprint.**  

"It will be built  
to last **a thousand years.**  

A vault  
that can only be maintained  
**by the power of the GemSTONEs.**"  

With meticulous precision,  
the **underground chamber**  
was constructed beneath Bern.  

Every **document,**  
every **artifact,**  
was carefully placed within.  

.  
.  
.  

The **Battle of Avignon—**  

Father Gregory’s **records.**  

Maria’s **portrait.**  

Pope Clement V’s **reports on Cesar.**  

The **battle formations**  
and strategies  
of the **GemSTON Knights.**  

The **myths** passed down  
through Maria’s family.  

The **banners** and **weapons**  
of the **Knights.**  

And on the **stone wall,**  
hung the **red cloak**  
of **Cesar.**  

.  
.  
.  

On the final day,  
with all tasks completed,  
Maria and Gerald  
stood together in Bern.  

Their wedding was  
**a simple affair.**  

"From now on,"  
Gerald whispered,  
"I will forget everything—  
**except you.**"  

Maria **smiled.**  

"I will, too."  

.  
.  
.  

Over time,  

**Truth became legend.**  

Legend became **a lullaby.**  

And soon,  

only children **remembered.**  

Until one day—  

it was **forgotten by all.**
