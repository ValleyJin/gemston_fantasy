# 7. Gemstone Energy
<br><br><br>

The tram in Bern rang its little bell as it moved along. <br>
For those driving cars, it could be an annoying presence, <br>
since cars, tourists, and street-level trams all merged in the same space during rush hours—a true headache. <br>

“We might be late.” <br>
Peter and Dr. Levi quickly parked the car in front of Cafe Marta and dashed inside. <br>

They switched on the TV, which was already showing a live broadcast of the Nobel Prize ceremony. <br>

“Think Dr. Drake will receive it today?” <br>
“Certainly, Grandpa. His research is as monumental as the discovery of nuclear energy.” <br>
“To think that an infinite energy source might lie within the Gemstones our family has preserved for generations…” <br>
“You donated them to CERN for research about five years ago, right, Grandpa?” <br>

Sure enough, Dr. Drake was announced as the Nobel laureate in Physics. <br>
During his acceptance speech, he radiated confidence: <br>

“These Gemstones hold a field of vibrational string energy. <br>
I want to share this joy with my research team, who labored day and night for the past five years. <br>
Above all, I owe gratitude to the Gemstone sample and to Dr. Peter Kandel, who made it accessible.” <br>

Peter showed Dr. Levi some photos from his lab. <br>
“What I’m trying to do is extract energy from the Gemstones. <br>
It’s tricky, because we’re talking about violent fluctuations in the extreme micro-scale.” <br>

“If I manage to crack that puzzle, next year’s Nobel goes to me, haha.” <br>
Their cheerful laughter echoed through Cafe Marta. <br>

“But Peter, even Dr. Drake is clueless about The Ring, I bet.” <br>
“Huh? The… Ring?” <br>

Dr. Levi took Peter’s hand and led him into the kitchen. <br>
The cafe’s basement connected through the kitchen, <br>
where an old ventilation flue could be shoved hard against the wall, <br>
unlocking the entire kitchen wall so it could slide aside. <br>

It was massively heavy—enough to blister your hands—but if one adult male leaned all his weight on it, it would budge. <br>
Together, they opened the wall and descended the stairs to the basement. <br>

# 8. The Pope in Avignon
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>

January 1314. Avignon Papacy.<br>
Avignon seldom froze in winter, <br>
but it poured cold rain without pause this day.<br>

“Is His Holiness in?”<br>
A Vatican envoy armed with a sword arrived.<br>

“He’ll be here by carriage any minute.”<br>
A guard led him to the reception room.<br>

There, Count Lenzburg was already sipping tea, <br>
waiting for Pope Clement V.<br>

The envoy hurried over, brimming with excitement. <br>
“Count Lenzburg, His Holiness was correct—there’s no such thing as an actual witch, is there? <br>
I scoured every Celtic village.”<br>

He warmed his body with a mug of hot milk.<br>
“No witches anywhere, but I did discover who Cesar really is.” <br>

“I told you from the start that man had hidden motives.”<br>
The envoy then rattled on about Cesar’s true identity.<br>

His key findings were simple:<br>

In recent decades, Celtic tribes occasionally had boys who could harness Gemstone energy. <br>
Their mothers often became priestesses, <br>
since the boy’s mysterious power gave them a means of livelihood. <br>

About a decade earlier, a priestess had shown up in one village with a boy, <br>
and that boy handled Gemstones with remarkable skill. <br>
Though the priestess earned good money reading fortunes, she soon went mad and died, <br>
while the boy vanished.<br>

“That boy is Cesar.” <br>
The envoy pulled out a scroll.<br>

Count Lenzburg, an old man with keen eyes, inspected it calmly.<br>

“They found this in Cesar’s old house, <br>
jammed with numbers. Possibly he uses them for magic. We’d better deal with him.”<br>

The count just glanced at it, unimpressed. <br>
“If it was that critical, why would Cesar leave it behind?”<br>

The envoy shrugged, admitting ignorance. <br>
He rose abruptly to check the window for the Pope’s carriage. <br>

“Ugh!” <br>
Suddenly, Cesar’s arm wrapped around the envoy’s neck, snapping it. <br>
He collapsed on the spot. <br>

“You idiot. If it were truly vital, I wouldn’t have left it there,” <br>
Count Lenzburg bellowed, then his face changed shape with startling speed.<br>

In mere seconds, he reverted to Cesar’s own face. <br>
His mechanical left arm had been fully repaired, <br>
hot steam rising from its joints.<br>

Cesar studied his reflection in a mirror, checking if he had properly morphed back.<br>
“Man, living as an old codger is revolting.” <br>

Just then, the large mirror slid aside, <br>
revealing a hidden compartment from which Pope Clement V emerged.<br>

“No need to be so startled, Cesar.” <br>
The Pope’s confident voice rang through the reception hall. <br>
“You’re the first to see this secret room. Feel honored, hoho.” <br>

Cesar found himself too stunned to speak, <br>
his hands trembling. <br>

“Heard everything, have we? But of course.” <br>
At the Pope’s signal, Templar knights encircled Cesar. <br>

“Hold on, wait!! I have something to show you.” <br>
Cesar frantically opened the door to the courtyard.<br>

There, Maria’s mother stood bound to a pillar.<br>

“That woman holds the key to tapping Gemstone power.” <br>
He ripped off the Gemstone necklace around her neck and aimed it at a tree in the yard. <br>

Fwoosh… <br>

In seconds, the tree erupted into flame and turned to ash. <br>
Though startled, the Pope quickly regained composure and glared at Cesar.<br>

“So you plan to harness that force to restore the old Roman Empire’s glory?”<br>
He sank into a chair, picking up a Bible. <br>

“And what’s your price?” <br>
He wore the look of someone who already knew the answer.<br>

After a brief pause, Cesar answered confidently.<br>
“I want you to crown me Emperor.”<br>

“Hahahahaha.”<br>
The Pope let out a booming laugh. <br>
“What an entertaining fellow.” <br>

After regaining his stern demeanor, the Pope fixed Cesar with a cold stare.<br>
“You think unifying the empire is merely a matter of force?”<br>
“But Your Holiness’s temporal authority is waning, no? <br>
You were forced into exile here in Avignon because you lacked power.” <br>
Cesar did not retreat.<br>

Without another word, Clement V left the reception hall. <br>
Taking a few steps, he glanced over his shoulder and gave Cesar a parting remark:<br>
“Let’s see if your plan is truly the will of the Lord.” <br>
