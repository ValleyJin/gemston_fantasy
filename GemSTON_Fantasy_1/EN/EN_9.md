# 9. Cesar Joins the Battle
<br><br><br>

Cesar slept an entire day in his Avignon residence.<br>

After the tension of negotiating successfully with the Pope, <br>
coupled with the dread of nearly revealing his identity, <br>
he suffered a series of nightmares.<br>

Upon waking from that long sleep, he looked for his Gemstones.<br>
He soon discovered they were now inside a pretty jewel box on a side table.<br>

Opening it, he noticed someone had carefully cleaned them—necklaces, Gemstones, all polished to a bright luster.<br>
He gazed at them for a long moment, then suddenly roared:<br>

“Arrgh! Who… who dared meddle with my things?!”<br>

He nearly shrieked, voice raw with rage. <br>
A maid hurried in from the next room.<br>
“I’m sorry, sir. I tidied them. Is something wrong?”

Cesar shook the necklace, pointing out the window at a tree in the courtyard.<br>
No effect at all.<br>

He stormed to the adjoining room, grabbed Maria’s mother by the collar, and shook her violently.<br>

“Why doesn’t this work anymore?!”<br>
“…I have no idea.”<br>
Even though she was tied up, Maria’s mother replied calmly.<br>

“Prayer is our strength. We Jews look only to God.”<br>

Cesar’s face grew red with rage.<br>

“A devil like you wouldn’t have tried praying, I suppose.”<br>
Maria’s mother spat her words with a curse-laden glare.<br>

“Hmph…”<br>
All at once, Cesar became oddly collected.<br>
Wearing only pajamas, he paced the room a few times in thought before something dawned on him.<br>

“I see. My mistake. You’re not the key—your daughter is.”<br>
Yet he was still unsure why only Maria could unlock that power.<br>

“That day, it was your daughter, not you, holding the necklace and praying, wasn’t it?”<br>
Maria’s mother denied it stubbornly, but Cesar just let out a scoff and rode off to his office.<br>

By evening, a spy from Bern contacted him.<br>
He reported that Maria had already left Bern for nearby Obwalden.<br>
<br>
“Impressive. She joined the Swiss independence forces to rescue her mother, who’s here in Avignon.”

Cesar quickly summoned a small unit of elite troops.<br>
He announced he would join that war.<br>

“I have to see for myself how that little lady wields Gemstone power… ha-ha-ha.”<br>
“Where shall we go, sir?”<br>
asked the cavalry captain. Cesar answered decisively:<br>

“To Switzerland. I’m returning to the Habsburg palace under Leopold I, and we too will take part in the war.”<br>

“But, Count Cesar, we’re still the Pope’s guards. Leaving Avignon for Switzerland…?”<br>
Already on horseback, Cesar drew his sword, laying it against the cavalry captain’s throat.<br>
“His Holiness has permitted it.”<br>

Noting the captain’s face turn pale, Cesar smirked with amusement.<br>
“You’ll want to heed my words more than the Pope’s if you hope for promotion. <br>
Haven’t you figured out where true power in the world is heading?”<br>

The cavalry captain nodded.<br>

Cesar sheathed his sword and gestured at Maria’s mother.<br>
“Take that woman as well. We’re going back to Switzerland together.”<br>
