# 30. The Space Shuttle   
      

**A remote highway in French Guiana.**  

"Wow! Irene, how did you even get this?  
It's been over **20 years** since internal combustion engines were banned!"  

Dr. Drake fastened his seatbelt tightly as he asked.  

"I went straight to the **manufacturer's museum** and dropped your **Nobel Prize-winning** name.  
Good PR for them, so they agreed. Haha."  

A **red car** roared along the coastline.  

The **humid monsoon wind** swept through the **coastal road**  
leading from **Cayenne International Airport** to the **Guiana Space Center (CSG).**  

As each **sharp curve** approached, Irene **drifted skillfully.**  

"This is an **LP 780-4.**  
It's the **last Lamborghini** ever built with a **V12 engine.**"  

As soon as the road straightened, Irene **slammed the accelerator.**  

The **powerful thrust** pressed Drake back into his seat.  

"You never forget what it's like  
to feel **raw power under your foot.**"  

They sped past **billboards** advertising  
the **Guiana Space Center (CSG)** and the **aerospace company De Morgan, LLC.**  

"Do you even know who **Peter Kandel's grandfather** is?"  

Drake frowned.  
"No idea…?"  

"Tada! **Dr. Andrew Levy.**"  

Drake blinked, stunned.  

"You're telling me **Levy sits on De Morgan's board**  
and Peter is his **grandson**?"  

"Exactly."  

Drake shook his head.  

"Peter **caused an incident at CERN** and didn't return.  
That can only mean one thing."  

Irene smirked.  

"He found a **clue about the Metal Armor**  
and went somewhere he could actually **use it.**"  

"And that 'somewhere' is **here.**  
The **space shuttle launch site.**"  

Irene flicked the steering wheel,  
sending the car into a smooth **drift.**  

"They're using the **Metal Armor**… in **space**?"  

"But where exactly?"  

"That's what we need to find out.  
But one thing is clear—  
Peter's **grandfather personally requested an extra passenger.**"  

Drake's interest **piqued.**  

"That **is** suspicious."  

"And another thing…"  

Irene **grinned.**  

"When I accessed the **cargo manifest,**  
I found an entry labeled simply **'Metal.'**"  

Drake **laughed dryly.**  

"Hah…  
Buried among **other lab materials,**  
no one but **us** would know what it really is."  

Drake clenched his fists.  

"Look ahead.  
We're almost there."  

As Irene **rolled down the window,**  
the **sounds of the jungle** flooded in—  
monkeys chattering, birds calling.  

Beyond the trees, the **De Morgan space shuttle** loomed **majestically.**  

In the distance, the **private launchpad** leased by **De Morgan** came into view.  

"Dr. Drake, we're almost there.  
And as I predicted, Peter **is boarding that shuttle.**"  

Drake shuddered.  

"Chilling."  

"But hey, what about those **two agents** we 'dealt with' earlier?"  

"They won't be found anytime soon.  
And even if they are, it'll be **after we return from space.**"  

"Those guys knew **more than we expected.**"  

"Exactly.  
I checked where the **shuttle is headed.**  

It's going to **Lagrange Point L4.**"  

Drake flipped through **a briefcase full of documents.**  

Among them were **two ID badges**—  
the credentials of the **dead agents.**  

"Sorry, nothing personal,"  
Drake murmured, almost **singing** the words.  

He flipped down the **car's sun visor mirror**  
and adjusted his **appearance.**  

By the time they reached the **space center,**  
Drake and Irene **looked exactly like** the agents they had killed.  

With **flawless disguises,**  
they **walked straight into** the **control center**  
and **joined the pre-flight preparations.**  

      

# 31. Reunion   
      

**December 20, 1315**  

News of **Johan's assassination** at the hands of **Keith,  
a Habsburg loyalist,** had finally reached **the Papal Palace in Avignon.**  

"Those **traitors!**"  

The Pope **clenched his fists in fury,**  
only to be overtaken by **violent coughing.**  

As he struggled for breath, **memories of the past resurfaced.**  

Johan had always been **a man of honor and loyalty.**  

The Pope himself had **chosen him**  
as the **leader of the Templar Order.**  

Keith had been the **better warrior,**  
but the Pope had refused to place a **Habsburg** in command.  

After all, the Pope’s true goal was **to escape Avignon  
and return to the Vatican. 

To do so, he had needed a **Templar leader**  
who would never betray him.  

"…What of Cesar?"  

"He disappeared after losing his duel to Gerald."  

"Now I have **no one** left on my side."  

Even if the Empire **was unified,**  
what did it matter if the **Pope had no influence?**  

The dream of a **Holy Roman Empire**  
was meaningless without **the Vatican at its heart.**  

"When I **disbanded the Templar Order**  
for engaging in **usury,**  
was there any resistance?"  

"Keith opposed it the most.  
He is, after all, a **Habsburg**,  
and power and wealth are his true ambitions."  

The Pope's **loyal attendant, Gregory,**  
spoke **succinctly,**  
as the Pope preferred.  

"Keith **killed Johan,**  
so I shall **excommunicate him** in the Pope's name!"  

"You cannot.  
There is **no justification.**  

Johan **did** protect Gerald,  
who is, after all, a **Swiss rebel.**"  

"Bah!  
Johan only did that because Gerald was **his brother!**"  

The Pope **coughed violently** once more.  

Then, sighing deeply, he **slumped into his chair.**  

"If Keith **takes control** of the Templars  
and gains **Cesar's GemSTONE,**  
he won't need my support anymore."  

"Indeed.  
He will become **Habsburg's right hand.**"  

The Pope requested **a cup of mulled wine.**  

As he waited, he gazed **out the window,  
his mind racing.**  

"Deliver this message for me."  

Gregory accepted the **sealed letter.**  

"A letter to whom?"  

"The **Swiss rebels** will win this war.  
Invite **Maria's group** here  
and **offer them sanctuary.**"  

"Are you certain…?"  

The Pope took **a slow sip** of his wine.  

"Until yesterday, I drank wine.  

Starting today…  
I think I'll stick with **mulled wine.**"
