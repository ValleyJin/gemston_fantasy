# 17. The Promised Land: Schwyz <br>
<br><br><br>

"Reducing taxes, granting titles—all just empty words."  
Gerald grasped the situation immediately.  
As soon as Schneider explained the emperor’s decree, he saw through the deception.  

"Who exactly received the emperor’s decree?"  
"The council did. They then passed it on to General Werner."  
"Then it’s likely that the council omitted any mention of the benefits they’d gain by handing Maria over."  

"Why would they do that?"  
"Because they were blinded by the promise of noble titles within the Holy Roman Empire."  

"Then the assassins who came after us..."  
"They were sent by the Obwalden council."  

"And what about my family in Obwalden?"  

The realization of betrayal filled them with fury and helplessness.  

"But! Maria. And you, Captain Schneider."  

Gerald’s voice, as strong and clear as his striking appearance, carried conviction.  

"Whether we return to Obwalden or not, the fate of Maria’s family has already been decided."  

A solemn silence settled over the group.  

"Now, we entrust everything to God and embark on our pilgrimage."  

As he spoke, Gerald never took his eyes off Maria.  
Maria clutched the gemstone tightly in her hand, lost in thought.  

Gerald re-hitched two horses to the carriage.  
Maria climbed back into the carriage and turned to Schneider.  

"Are we heading to Uri? Or back to Obwalden?"  

"To where Switzerland’s independence lies."  
Maria’s simple answer made everyone smile.

Dawn was breaking.  

The two men, now more at ease, chatted to keep sleep at bay.  

"Gerald, where did you say you were from?"  
"Near Rome. But I am not Roman."  
"You came all this way just to find Maria? Impressive."  

"Wait—how did you hear about Maria?"  
"There was a report sent to the Papacy about a ‘witch’ appearing in a village. It came from Duke Zähringen..."  
"Ah, so you were with the Pope?"  
"That night, there was a banquet at the Avignon. My family was invited, and I happened to overhear."  

Schneider’s curiosity deepened.  

"What does your family do, to receive such invitations from the Pope?"  

Gerald simply smiled.  

"Wait a minute—your quiver...!"  

As daylight fully emerged, they could now see each other clearly.  
Schneider noticed the ornate design on Gerald’s quiver, as well as the emblem on his cloak.  

"The five arrows embroidered on that leather quiver... That’s the Rothschild family crest!"  

And sure enough, on his cloak was the Rothschild coat of arms.  

"Ha ha! It’s no big deal. I’m just the youngest son—I have no real power."  

Maria, exhausted, remained asleep.  
Their carriage pressed on through the Swiss countryside, covered in morning dew.

**Uri Canton. Schwyz Canton.**  

For a month, they traveled through both regions.  
Fortunately, the spirit of resistance there was unwavering.  

Compared to Obwalden, these regions were wealthier and more self-sufficient.  

Thanks to Schneider’s reputation as a legendary mercenary captain, they were welcomed wherever they went.  

But trouble arose from an unexpected source.  

The gemstone.  

"Maria, during today’s demonstration, you obliterated an entire hillside with the gemstone’s power. The people are terrified."  

"Some even called Maria a witch," Gerald added.  

Maria, however, remained resolute.  

"At first, they must be shocked.  
But if I offer to let them use the power for themselves, they will be thrilled."  

And she was right.  

At the evening banquet with local elders and generals, Maria proposed lending out gemstones.  

They all smiled in agreement.  

They even accepted the condition of placing gold as collateral.  

Freedom from foreign rule was worth more than gold.  

The gold was to be sent to Obwalden by May 4th.  
Maria’s group had to return before then to personally oversee the distribution of the gemstones.  

"By the way... The Rothschilds will be safeguarding this gold. I wonder if my family agreed to it?"  

Maria hurried toward Schwyz.  

And there, a miracle awaited.  

Schwyz was the home of Werner, the supreme commander of the Swiss independence forces.  

Because of this, Maria’s arrival stirred great interest.  

But that wasn’t all.  

As word of Maria’s pilgrimage spread, hidden warriors from across Northern Europe had already gathered in Schwyz, waiting for her.  

The son of a Celtic priestess murdered by Cesar.  
Mountain-dwelling Jewish mystics capable of miracles.  
Swiss mechanical artisans renowned for their craftsmanship.  

Schneider, an experienced commander of foreign units, quickly saw the potential in this force.  

At his suggestion, they all agreed to march with Maria to Obwalden.  

They wanted to fight alongside her.  

"Did you hear? Even the son of the Celtic priestess has joined us. They say he can summon dragons in battle!"  

"Everyone knows those dragons are illusions. But people panic and flee...  
And the fire they breathe—it feels real enough to cause pain!"  

Rumors spread like wildfire, strengthening the Swiss independence movement.  

By the time Maria’s group returned to Obwalden, their numbers had grown into a full-fledged unit.  

Spring had arrived, bringing warm evenings perfect for camping under the stars.  

Days were spent traveling, nights in joyous celebration.  

Yet, the greatest surprise of all was Schneider’s discovery—  

Gerald had proposed to Maria.  

As they often rode out together for horseback lessons,  
Maria, a teenage girl, and Gerald, a young man, found themselves drawn to one another.  

"Maria, no matter how short this war is, it will take at least five years, right?"  

"Yes. The Swiss will fight until they win."  

"Little lady, then I will propose to you when the war ends. Will you accept?"  

Maria laughed.  

"And if the war lasts a hundred years? Then you’d be proposing to my grave!"  

But Gerald did not laugh.  

"You’re serious, aren’t you, Gerald?"
