# 23. Maria’s Secret Revealed   
      

"You fool. Do you think trembling like that will save your life?"   
Leopold I snatched the spear from Esencino and charged at the peasant militia.   

With the power of the GemSTONE, the halberd spun like a windmill,   
severing the heads of knights who were assisting Leopold, sending them flying into the air.   

But Leopold himself was an exceptional knight,   
a ruler hardened by extensive battle experience.   

Firing a volley of arrows to carve a temporary escape route,   
he hoisted his cousin Esencino onto his horse and attempted a breakthrough.   

"We must capture him!"   
Gerald fired his longbow, but Leopold swiftly dodged and fled.   

From the far end of the Morgarten Gorge, Max spotted Leopold approaching.   
However, Max himself was exhausted from prolonged battle and felt uncertain about facing him.   

Moreover, the distance from Maria, who could channel the power of the GemSTONE, was significant.   
Max had to shatter Leopold’s lance purely with his own strength.   

"Can I do this...?"   
Max steadied his ragged breath and gripped his halberd firmly with both hands.   

Leopold’s white stallion charged straight toward Max.   
At that moment, a pair of black horses ridden by Celtic twin warriors rammed into Leopold from the side.   

All their horses tumbled to the ground.   
Leopold I and Esencino, who had fallen, quickly regained their footing.   

Henkel and Aidan, the twin sons of the Celtic priestess,   
lifted their fallen black horses and rushed toward the exhausted Max.   

"Max! Can you hold on?"   
"Thanks for coming. But I’m too tired to face Leopold right now."   
"We’re Linkers. We’ll bring the power of the GemSTONE here."   

Henkel mounted his horse and raised a massive lance embedded with a GemSTONE high into the air.   
From afar, Maria channeled the GemSTONE’s light into the lance.   

"Much better now."   
The GemSTONE embedded in Max’s halberd also began to glow brightly.   

Max’s face brightened as he spun his halberd with one hand.   
The GemSTONE embedded in his halberd and armor radiated an intense blue light.   

*Crack!*   

Aidan’s swiftly thrown lance shattered Leopold’s shield.   
With Leopold left defenseless, Max lunged in and swung his halberd down.   

*Thud.*   

"Brother… Ugh…"   

The scream came from Esencino.   
Leopold had grabbed Esencino by the collar and used him as a shield against the incoming halberd.   
Esencino, with the blade embedded in his chest, let out a final cry and collapsed.   

As Leopold, Aidan, and Max engaged in fierce combat, the GemSTONE’s flashes illuminated the battlefield.   

"You bastards! Are you using magic?"   
Leopold demonstrated his exceptional equestrian combat skills, parrying Aidan and Max’s attacks one after another.   

"What the hell are these cursed lights?"   
Leopold, puzzled yet awed by the power of the GemSTONE, struggled against their overwhelming force.   

"It seems Cesar was right. Someone here can harness the power of the GemSTONE."   
Finally, Leopold I’s officers arrived and surrounded him.   
"But where is Cesar? He was supposed to pass through this gorge ahead of us, yet he’s nowhere to be seen."   
Leopold gasped for breath and surveyed the battlefield.   

But up on the Morgarten Hill,   
Cesar observed the entire scene through a spyglass.   

"I just saw a GemSTONE’s flash heading toward Leopold."   
With a sinister grin, Cesar adjusted his spyglass again.   
"Where did that flash come from? Haha... The old oak forest at the entrance of the gorge."   

He quickly mounted his horse and commanded his men.   
"Let’s move! I’ve found Maria’s location!"   

Unaware of this, Maria remained hidden in the ancient oak forest,   
channeling the GemSTONE’s energy.   

With both palms stretched out, she positioned the GemSTONE pile between them.   
The GemSTONE’s light repeatedly scanned across her palms in a rhythmic motion.   

Discarding expired GemSTONEs,   
she reached for a new box, preparing to draw more energy when—   

"Ah!"   
Maria let out a scream.   
Her hands were suddenly bound by thick ropes, yanked backward.   
It was the work of Cesar’s men, who had swiftly infiltrated the ranks of the peasant militia.   
They soon bound Maria’s hands to a cross.   

"Haha… So it’s the hands."   
Cesar chuckled, bringing his face close to Maria’s.   

"Make sure to keep her hands separated at all times!"   
Cesar swiftly loaded Maria onto a carriage and left the scene.   
With Maria gone, the battlefield changed dramatically.   

Without the power of the GemSTONE, the peasant militia suddenly felt drained and lost their morale.   
Their spears and swords lost their destructive force, and within moments, they were pushed back.   

The Swiss Confederacy’s forces began falling one by one.   
Leopold and his men launched a breakthrough and successfully escaped the Morgarten Gorge.   

Meanwhile, in the carriage, Cesar glanced at the bound Maria.   
"I suspected there was something special about your hands, but I never imagined it was your palms themselves."   
"I don’t know what you mean. I was merely praying."   
"Enough of that noble nonsense. Haha."   

As soon as they exited the Morgarten Gorge, they reached a secluded forest where Cesar’s main forces lay hidden.   
His men hurriedly melted wax and took casts of Maria’s hands.   

"You’ll suffer divine punishment for this!"   
Maria cursed him, but Cesar merely smirked.   
"Punishment? One must die to receive divine judgment. And I do not die. Haha."   

A memory from childhood flickered in Cesar’s mind.   

A beautiful Celtic priestess had taken him in when he was a wandering orphan.   
But the other priestesses despised him, labeling him a demon who would bring ruin upon the world.   
They had even tried to kill him.   

"This child is innocent!"   
Though he called her ‘mother,’ the other priestesses treated him like a monster.   
"Do you really see a child before you? This boy is a demon!"   

One of their swords had mercilessly severed his left arm.   

Snapping out of his reverie, Cesar touched his mechanical left arm.   
"Now I understand. If my original arm had remained intact…   
I too could have controlled all the GemSTONEs like Maria."   

Through his spyglass, Cesar watched as Leopold barely managed to escape the gorge.   
Meanwhile, his men finished taking wax molds of Maria’s hands and presented them to him.   

"Once the casts are complete, burn her hands with a branding iron."   
Cesar’s cold command even startled his own men.   
Yet he continued watching the battlefield below, as the Swiss militia were slaughtered mercilessly.   

"With Maria’s hands destroyed, only we shall hold the power of the GemSTONEs."   
Holding the wax molds in his hands, Cesar grinned with satisfaction.   

"Ugh…!"   
Cesar let out a strangled cry.   

Clutching at his chest, he looked down at the long object protruding through it.   
An arrow.   
The arrowhead bore the crest of the Rothschild family, inscribed with five arrows.   
Struggling to turn, he saw Gerald, a hundred paces away, standing atop a boulder.   

"I still have about twenty arrows left."   
Gerald’s voice rang out like thunder.   
"Three per head should be enough."   

Riding forward, Gerald loosed three arrows in succession, instantly killing Cesar’s closest officers.   
The remaining soldiers fled in terror, leaving Gerald to cut Maria free.   

Gerald rummaged through Cesar’s belongings.   
"What the hell was this guy?"   
He pulled out a scroll bearing a Celtic symbol.   

It was filled with a series of prime numbers.   
Maria took out the scroll given to her by her mother and compared it.   

The numbers were identical.   

"These numbers aren’t random—they’re prime numbers."   
"Cesar said my hands were the key to using the GemSTONEs."   
"What connection do prime numbers have with your hands?"   
Maria and Gerald exchanged puzzled glances.   

At that moment, the dying Cesar gasped out his final words.   

"Leopold… has escaped."   
Cesar coughed up blood.   

"Leopold… won’t let this humiliation stand…"   
"And?"   

"Your mother… is in his palace basement."   
Maria and Gerald’s eyes widened in shock.   
Cesar chuckled darkly before breathing his last.
