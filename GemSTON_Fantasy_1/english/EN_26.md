# 26. The Resurrection of Cesar   
      

**December 12, 1315 – Late Night**  

"It has been a month since our victory at Morgarten.  
By now, they must believe we won’t march toward Habsburg territory, letting their guard down."  

A small forest path leading to **Habsburg Palace**.  

Maria and Gerald moved cautiously, accompanied only by a small unit, preparing for a surprise attack.  

However…  

"They are coming, just as Johan predicted. It has been nearly a month, and they are finally here."  

"That must be Maria’s group, right? Johan truly deserves to be the leader of our Templar Order."  

The **Templar Order**, lying in ambush, made final adjustments to their attack formation.  

"Let them taste what it’s like to be caught in an ambush."  

Keith, one of the **Templars’ most skilled archers**, swiftly fired three arrows in succession.  

The two leading horses pulling Maria’s carriage collapsed forward.  
The carriage, carrying Maria, tilted violently and fell onto its side.  

As soon as the carriage fell,  
Keith prepared a fire arrow soaked in oil and shot three more in quick succession.  

Maria’s carriage **erupted into flames.**  

The fire illuminated the battlefield, making the carriage an easy target.  
Templar soldiers, hidden throughout the gorge under Leopold’s command, **rained down arrows like a storm** toward the burning wreck.  

"I can’t even tell where the arrows are coming from! Scatter!"  

The **GemSTON Knights** dispersed in all directions, while Gerald attempted to escape the gorge with Maria on his horse.  

Maria’s father, however, had already identified the source of the fire arrows **the moment the first three struck.**  

"Gerald, take Maria and go. I will hold them off."  

"The ones firing those flaming arrows must be their leaders."  

He crossed a small stream and climbed onto a rock, scanning the area.  
At last, **he spotted the Templars positioned atop the cliffs, firing their flaming arrows from 200 paces above.**  

Silently, Maria’s father moved further uphill, stealthily positioning himself above the Templars.  

Using the branch of an **old tree as a lever,** he attempted to roll a massive boulder down onto them.  

"This is difficult without Maria’s presence. I can’t use the power of the GemSTONE."  

No matter how hard he pushed, the rock wouldn’t budge.  

**Whiiiiiish!**  

A **crossbow net** shot through the air.  

In an instant, Maria’s father was entangled and tumbled down the slope,  
rolling directly in front of the Templars below.  

The Templar soldiers **stared in shock.**  

"What… Who is this?"  

Then, from above, a voice rang out, followed by **laughter echoing through the night.**  

"Who goes there!?"  

Johan, holding a torch, raised it high to illuminate the figure approaching.  

"C… Cesar??"  

"It has been a while, Johan. I hear the Templar Order’s reputation has suffered due to their involvement in money lending. Haha."  

"What is this…? I was told you were shot through the chest and killed."  

The Templar soldiers **murmured in disbelief.**  

"You still fail to grasp the power of the GemSTONE. Tsk, tsk."  

Behind Cesar, a familiar figure emerged—**Tori, the raccoon automaton.**  

Tori **grinned** and lifted a glowing **Red GemSTONE**,  
swaying it in the air as **his eyes glowed red.**  

"Could it be…? Did your automaton heal you?"  

"Tori saved me, but calling it ‘healing’ wouldn’t be accurate.  
Hmm… No, it wouldn’t be right to call it that."  

Cesar took a few steps, then **turned his head and smiled** at Johan.  

"Rather than ‘healing,’ I’d say I was ‘repaired.’ Haha."  

With each step he took, **a metallic clang echoed through the gorge.**  

Now, not only his left arm but even **his chest made a sound of metal striking metal.**  

"What… are you?"  

Johan shook his head in disbelief.  

"If we capture Maria now, half of my GemSTONEs will be in the hands of the Templar Order."  

Cesar smirked and **extended a proposal.**  

"Johan, how about we join forces?"  

"Don’t be ridiculous. I thought that conversation ended long ago.  
You don’t even believe in God."  

Johan **drew his sword**, standing firmly against Cesar.  

"Whoa, whoa… Let’s set that aside for now."  

Cesar glanced at Maria’s father.  

"Tie him to a tree and set torches around him.  
Make sure he is visible from a distance."  

He was right.  

The flickering **torchlight in the gorge** soon caught Gerald’s eye.  

As he was regathering his scattered troops, Gerald peered through his spyglass.  

There, in the distance, he saw **Maria’s father tied to a tree.**  

"Don’t go, Gerald. It’s obviously a trap!"  

"Even if it is, I have to go.  
Those bastards will kill him without hesitation."  

"The GemSTONEs in our carriage have burned up.  
I can’t use my powers right now."  

"Even without them, we can win."  

**Charging toward the Templars, Gerald rode with defiant confidence.**  

As he approached, he pulled his horse into a large circular motion,  
then suddenly reined in the **stallion, lifting its front hooves high.**  

"Johan!!!"  

Gerald’s **booming voice** echoed through the gorge.  

With every word, his tone carried power and command.  

"The leader of the Templar Order!"  
"And!"  
"My eldest brother!"  
"The heir of House Rothschild!"  

The **Templars whispered among themselves.**  

"What? Could it really be… Gerald?"  

"Step aside!"  

Johan, his face **contorted with anger,** rode his horse down the slope.  

Now, in the center of the gorge, the two brothers faced each other.  

"Gerald! Why have you joined these Swiss peasants in their petty war?"  

Johan’s voice **dripped with contempt.**  

But Gerald did not back down.  

"Brother, look at yourself."  

He began **circling Johan on horseback.**  

"Look at what you wear!"  

"A crimson cape bestowed by the Pope."  
"A majestic red stallion with a shining mane."  
"And a sword adorned with jewels."  

"What are you getting at?"  

"The Templar Order has abandoned God.  
Now, it only pursues wealth and power."  

Gerald dismounted, **throwing his bow aside** and **unsheathing his sword.**  

"I challenge you to a duel."  

"I have no intention of fighting my own brother.  
But any Templar knight may step forward in your place."  

"What do you plan to gain from this?"  

"If I win, I take Maria’s father.  
If your Templars win, you take Maria."  

Johan hesitated.  

"And if I refuse?"  

Gerald **walked toward him.**  

"Then I’ll make sure the entire empire knows the truth—  
that the Templar Order turned down a duel out of **fear.** Haha."  

Rustling came from the shadows.  

A figure stepped forward.  

"I shall be his opponent."  

A familiar voice.  

The figure stepped into the torchlight.  

"C… Cesar?"  

"Don’t be so shocked, Gerald.  
Ah, yes… You did shoot me through the chest with your bow, didn’t you?"  

"Since he’ll die soon anyway,  
why not reveal our secret to him first?"  

From behind, **Tori grinned mischievously.**  

Cesar unfastened his armor and exposed his chest.  

Gerald **froze in place.**  

The center of Cesar’s chest **was no longer flesh.**  

A **complex mechanical system** replaced his missing torso,  
with a **massive GemSTONE pulsating at its core.**  

"My power has only grown stronger. Haha."  

"You… monster."  

Gerald **roared, gripping his sword.**  

"I will end you once and for all."  

Late into the night, only the distant calls of owls filled the gorge.
