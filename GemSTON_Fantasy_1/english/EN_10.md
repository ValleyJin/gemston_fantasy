# 10. Mining  
  

"Father, where are we going?"    
"To Obwalden. That damned empire took your mother, so we must fight them."    

Steering the rattling carriage, her father said nothing for a while.    
"That's the only way we can bring her back, isn't it?"    

Maria's eyes sparkled as she replied,    
"Mother is still alive. I can feel it."    

"The House of Habsburg is full of repulsive bastards."    
From the rear seat, Max interjected.    
"I heard there's a battle against them in Obwalden, and honestly, I couldn't sit still when I heard the news! Hahaha."    

"You could be rich just by monopolizing candle sales at your mine."    
Maria's father still eyed him with skepticism.    
"So why throw yourself into a war?"    

Max scoffed and leaned back onto the haystack.    
"Guess you Jews don't quite understand us Swiss."    
He chuckled and stretched out his legs.    
"We hate interference. We'd rather just live quietly, watching the sun rise and set over these mountains."    

After biting off a chunk of bread, he added,    
"Politics? Empires? Wars? We don't care about any of that."    

Maria's uncle looked at Max uneasily.    
"But why are you here, Max? What's your real reason?"    

"Well… that's a long story."    
Max scratched his head, as if hesitant.    
"Oh, let me explain instead," he said, straightening up.    

He recounted his encounter with Cesar—    
how he saw the terrifying mechanical left arm, its immense power,    
how it reeked of something unholy.    

And when Maria's mother was taken away,    
he felt guilty.    

"So, from now on, I'll call you 'big brother.'"    
Max clapped Maria's father on the back.    
"I've been rude before. I'll do my best to get your wife back. Hahaha!"    

As the sun set, darkness engulfed the road.    
Wolves howled in the distance.    
Max reached for a candle to hang on the front of the carriage,    
but then, he turned to Maria.    

"Wait, we don't need this. Maria! Tie a Gemstone onto the carriage instead."    

Maria untied the cloth securing the Gemstone-filled sack.    
As she cupped one in both hands, a brilliant light emanated from within.    

"Ah, too bright."    
She quickly wrapped the Gemstone in another layer of cloth to dim it.    

"Father, I think the Gemstones' glow is getting stronger over time."    
"Really? I only ever collected them with your mother. I never paid close attention."    

"Back in the mine, we just used them for lighting."    
During the journey to Obwalden, Maria realized that the Gemstones were continuously mining—    
not in the human sense, but extracting power over time, growing stronger.

"Whoa! Whoa!!!"    

The horses suddenly whinnied in terror,    
rearing up wildly.    

Not far ahead, dozens of glowing blue eyes gleamed in the dark.    

"Wolves… When did they start following us?"    
Max grabbed a halberd and prepared to jump off the carriage.    

"Are you insane? That's too many of them. Stay inside and hold your position!"    

The terrified horses galloped at full speed.    
Maria's father struggled to rein them in,    
but they wouldn't stop.    

"Brother, if we keep going like this, the carriage will tip over!"    

Her father had no choice.    
He cut the reins, releasing the horses.    

The freed animals bolted in all directions,    
and the wolves immediately chased them instead.    

They were stranded—    
left alone in the middle of the icy mountain pass.    

In the distance, the agonized cries of the horses echoed.    

"Maria, light a torch! And the rest of you, draw your weapons!"    

Barricading both ends of the carriage,    
the men prepared for an ambush.    

Thud!    

The lead wolf lunged at the rear entrance,    
but Maria's uncle struck it with his spear, sending it stumbling backward.    

More wolves gathered, their snarls reverberating in the snow.    

"We're outnumbered. They'll rush in all at once!"    

Maria's father swung his torch wildly to keep them at bay.    
Meanwhile, Maria clutched a Gemstone tightly,    
raising it toward the wolves.    

But… nothing happened.    

"Father, I don't know how to trigger the light burst."    
"Didn't you use it against Cesar before?"    

"That time, I was only holding it and praying for Mother."    

Her father didn't have time to respond.    
The wolves advanced.    

"Then do that. Pray like you did before!"    

Maria threw away her torch,    
clasped the Gemstone between her hands,    
and prayed.    

A deep blue glow slowly emerged.    

"Ah… I finally understand how to use them!"    

FLASH!    

A brilliant burst of light erupted from the Gemstone,    
ripping through the wolves like a thunderclap.    

The air filled with the acrid stench of burning fur.    

The surviving wolves whimpered and fled.    

Maria's father pulled her into an embrace.    
"You've saved us again, my daughter."    

"Father, the Gemstones are growing stronger…    
Where does this power even come from?"    

"I don't know."    
Her father sighed.    
"And honestly, that scares me a little."    

They gathered themselves,    
secured the damaged carriage,    
and checked their supplies.    

Then, with no horses left,    
they tied ropes around their waists    
and pulled the carriage up the snowy incline.    

By dawn,    
they had finally reached the first village of Obwalden.
