# 11. The Power of the Gemstone <br>
<br><br><br>

At last, Maria's family arrived in Obwalden.<br>
They checked the Gemstones Maria had sent ahead in advance.<br>

"Father, these Gemstones… they've grown even brighter!"<br>
Maria held one in both hands, just as she had done in the carriage, and activated its glow.<br>

Late at night, as soon as she stepped into the village,<br>
the light of the Gemstones spread throughout the settlement.<br>
All the weary villagers stirred as if infused with new energy.<br>

"Max, a scouting party came ahead of us and spread the word.<br>
They say a Jewish family has brought a miracle to aid the resistance."<br>

"You bet. I saw with my own eyes how they crushed the Emperor's men with a Gemstone boulder."<br>
"So I guess you're done with your candle business?"<br>

"Hah! Who needs candles when Switzerland is on the brink of independence?"<br>

On the mountain pass to Obwalden, villagers scurried about.<br>
They piled up firewood, prepared torches, and readied stones.<br>
The men sharpened halberds, axes, and spears on a whetstone.<br>
The moonlight reflected sharply off their polished edges.<br>

Maria stood before a large boulder,<br>
her father's dagger fastened with a Gemstone to the hilt.<br>

She held the Gemstone in both hands, her father gripping his dagger tightly.<br>

"Alright!"<br>
With a powerful strike, the boulder **split clean in half**.<br>

Next, they fastened a Gemstone to the catapult's release mechanism.<br>
When they launched a stone, it flew nearly ten times farther than expected,<br>
crashing into the reservoir and sending up a spray of sparks.<br>

"Everyone, did you see that? I'll distribute these Gemstones so you can attach them to your weapons."<br>
Maria dropped a heavy sack to the ground and handed out the glowing stones.<br>

The villagers erupted in cheers.<br>
For the first time in a long while, hope returned to their faces.<br>

<br><br><br>

# 12. Staking <br>
<br><br><br>

"Obwalden isn't the only one. Uri, Schwyz—every Swiss canton willing to fight—<br>
they all want access to the power of the Gemstones."<br>

Werner Stauffacher, the commander of the Swiss independence army,<br>
ran his hand over the Gemstone embedded in his sword hilt and looked at Maria's father.<br>

"But we can't just give them to anyone. <br>
Besides, only Maria has been able to awaken their full power so far."<br>

"You saw how the villagers rejoiced last night. <br>
In war, morale is more crucial than the enemy's numbers."<br>
Werner glanced around at the flickering watchfires.<br>
He patted Maria's father on the shoulder.<br>
"Talk to Maria. She might find a way."<br>

Back at their lodging, they found Max devouring roasted chicken,<br>
washing it down with beer. Maria sat beside him, nibbling bits of food,<br>
gravy smeared on her cheeks.<br>

Her uncle Andrea and Max, already in high spirits,<br>
were singing a loud Swiss folk song, arms linked.<br>

"When did you two become such good friends?"<br>
Maria's father sighed at the sight.<br>

Pulling Maria aside, he lowered his voice.<br>
"I'm uneasy about the Gemstones. <br>
The more I see them used, the more I feel we're handling something beyond us."<br>

"Me too, Father."<br>
Maria adjusted the leather strap that held a Gemstone pendant around her neck.<br>
"Mother always had nightmares about Gemstones…<br>
She said something dark was lurking within them. That scares me."<br>

Her father nodded solemnly.<br>

"But is there a way to properly harness their energy?<br>
Last night, you activated one and it lit up an entire bag of them."<br>

Maria tossed a single Gemstone into a sack. <br>
Immediately, every other stone inside began to glow.<br>

"When I release a Gemstone's power, it triggers all others it touches.<br>
This sack is shining because of the one I activated."<br>

Her father sighed deeply.<br>
"If we start lending them out, the power could be abused."<br>

"What if we ask for collateral?"<br>

"Like gold?"<br>
Maria answered without hesitation.<br>

"But we're wanderers. We can't store all that gold ourselves."<br>

"Right. That's where the Rothschild family comes in."<br>
Max, having overheard, poked his head up from under the table, his hair disheveled.<br>

Maria nodded.<br>
"They run the finest jewel trade and banking networks.<br>
If we let them manage the transactions, we can lend out the Gemstones."<br>

Her father frowned. "Would they even agree?"<br>

Max smirked.<br>
"Their patriarch recently fell ill, and the eldest son just took over.<br>
They might be more open to new ventures now. The old man was too stubborn."<br>

A few days later, Maria's father wrote a letter to the Rothschild family.<br>

At the same time, Schneider, the mercenary captain, was tasked with handpicking soldiers<br>
to escort Maria on her journey through the Swiss cantons.<br>

"If Maria travels and demonstrates the Gemstone's power firsthand,<br>
it will surely inspire more to rise up."<br>
Werner, the commander, gave his orders.<br>

Maria rummaged through her sack and picked out a large Gemstone for Schneider.<br>
"You're huge, so you need a big one too!"<br>

"Haha! Thanks, young lady."<br>

Within the week, Maria was set to embark on her journey.<br>
That night, restless, she visited her grandmother's house,<br>
where they whispered about old Gemstone legends until dawn.<br>
