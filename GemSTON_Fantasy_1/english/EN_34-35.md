# 34. The Awakening of The Ring <br>
<br><br><br>

Upon reaching **lunar orbit,**  
Peter **gasped** in awe.  

For the past **40 years,**  
the **lunar supply base** had undergone **continuous expansion.**  

Now, its sheer scale was **breathtaking.**  

"You've **never seen** anything like this before, have you?"  

Disguised as **intelligence agents,**  
Dr. Drake and Irene smirked,  
pretending to be **accustomed** to such grand structures.  

But in reality,  
even **they** were amazed by the **scale of the space exploration facility.**  

And more than that,  
they were **curious.**  

How exactly was **the Metal Armor**  
meant to function **in deep space?**  

The **first-ever lunar orbital station,**  
NASA's **Lunar Gateway,**  
had been gradually expanded over the decades.  

De Morgan, the company **led by Dr. Levy,**  
had even **added its own module** to the station.  

This module was named **Maria Station,**  
serving as a **dedicated base**  
for missions to **Lagrange Point L4.**  

"Peter, there has never been **another mission**  
in human history where so much **money**  
was spent on **a single objective.**"  

Dr. Levy pointed to the **space shuttle, Gerald I,**  
which was docked at the module.  

"See that?  
The **Rothschild family** funded **the entire construction.**  

Thanks to them,  
this **project remained a complete secret.**"  

**Gerald I** was a **rotating cylindrical vessel,**  
with **two small exploration modules**  
attached on either side.  

Because it was **constructed in space**  
and only operated **in a vacuum,**  
it could be built **on a much larger scale**  
than traditional shuttles.  

"Just refueling and restocking **each shuttle**  
takes over **three months.**  

That's why we operate **three shuttles in rotation.**  

The cost is… **astronomical.**"  

Dr. Levy explained everything **patiently** to his grandson.  

"Elon Musk played a **huge role** in this.  

The **Power and Propulsion Element (PPE)**  
and the **Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO)**  

were both installed here in **2027**  
via **SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket.**"  

After docking at **Lunar Gateway,**  
the team **transferred** to **Gerald I.**  

Their **supplies and fuel** had already been **fully loaded by drones.**  

These **drones** continuously transported resources  
via the **Lunar Elevator,**  
a **space tether system**  
stretching **150 km above the Moon's surface.**  

With **ample resources** and **a spacious environment,**  
the **four-month journey** to L4 was **comfortable.**  

One **interesting** aspect of the trip—  
Peter often **ran into Irene** during his **morning exercise.**  

However, since **her disguise**  
was that of a **muscular male agent,**  
Peter treated her **casually, like a friend.**  

"She's really **fun to talk to**  
and knows a lot.  

She's got a **strong grasp of physics,**  
so we always end up talking for a while."  

Dr. Levy chuckled.  

"Haha, you just **can't stop talking about that friend, can you?**"  

"I even invited her to **visit my home in Bern**  
after we return to Earth!  

She seemed **really excited** about it."  

Dr. Levy **never suspected a thing.**  

The **two agents** acted **so naturally,**  
so **human.**  

They seemed like **good people.**

As **The Ring** finally came into view,  
everyone **held their breath.**  

"It looks like a **giant, lifeless donut, doesn't it?**  

Since it was activated **40 years ago,**  
it has never functioned **again.**  

**Today,** we're going to **reignite it**  
using **the Metal Armor.**"  

"The Metal Armor **will bring The Ring back to life.**  

But… what will happen **when it awakens?**"  

Peter used a **laser cutter**  
to remove **a small section** of the Metal Armor.  

"We **only need** the part  
that contains **Grandma Maria's fingerprint.**  

The rest is **unnecessary.**"  

Once cut,  
the extracted piece consisted of **two thin metal plates,**  
each about the **size of a cigarette pack.**  

Dr. Levy carefully **reviewed the docking procedures**  
for The Ring.  

"AI will handle most of the process,  
but we **still need to understand** the steps ourselves."  

He and Peter then moved **to the center** of Gerald I.  

As they left the **rotating outer ring**  
and approached the **central docking module,**  
the **gravity gradually disappeared.**  

They boarded **the right-side exploration module**  
for the docking mission.  

Meanwhile, the **two DNI agents**  
boarded the **left module** for backup.  

Of course, those agents were **actually Drake and Irene.**  

But no one knew that.  

.  
.  
.  

"This material…  
It's **solid, but incredibly light.**  

Grandpa, what exactly is it?"  

After docking with **The Ring,**  
Peter **touched its inner walls** curiously.  

"It's **mostly carbon,**  
but the **structural arrangement** is unlike anything on Earth.  

We **can't manufacture this.**"  

Inside the **zero-gravity control room,**  
Peter retrieved **the Metal Armor.**  

He placed it **gently**  
into what **seemed to be a scanning slot.**  

A **soft light**  
immediately **swept over the metal.**  

Then—  

**Click…**  

At first, there was a **harsh grinding noise.**  

Then, a **deep vibration** began.  

Peter looked out the window.  

"The **stars are spinning…**"  

Dr. Levy placed a **hand on his shoulder.**  

"Peter, it's not the **stars** that are moving.  

It's **The Ring.**"  

Slowly, a **gravitational pull**  
began to form inside.  

The two men could now **stand**  
as if they were **on solid ground.**  

Inside The Ring,  
lights **flashed on,**  
and **holographic monitors** appeared **out of nowhere.**  

"Who…  
**built this?**"  

Just then,  
two **chairs** detached from the floor  
and **slid forward.**  

The men **sat down cautiously.**  

On the **central monitor,**  
a rotating **image of Earth** appeared.  

Then—  

A **blinking marker** appeared  
over a **specific location.**  

"That's… **Switzerland.**"  

More precisely—  

**Cafe Marta.**  

"It's pointing **directly at the cafe.**"  

"Of course."  

Dr. Levy reached toward the monitor  
and **tapped a glowing button.**  

"There are **no physical buttons** anywhere.  

It seems they designed it  
to **avoid mechanical failure**  
and **last as long as possible.**"  

.  
.  
.  

At first, there was **no response.**  

Then—  

**BOOM!**  

A **powerful shockwave**  
rippled through The Ring.  

The entire **structure shuddered,**  
and the vibrations **intensified.**  

"Peter!  
It's absorbing **a massive surge of energy!**"  

"It must be coming from **Cafe Marta!**"  

The two men **gripped their seats tightly.**  

The shaking grew so violent  
that Dr. Levy's **chair nearly tore loose.**  

"Peter!!!"  

Peter **held onto Levy with one arm,**  
while using his **other hand**  
to keep the Metal Armor **secure in the slot.**  

"This thing isn't…  
about to **explode, is it?**"  

But before Peter could think further—  

**BANG.**  

His head **slammed against the console,**  
and his **vision went dark.**  

.  
.  
.  

Above them,  
a **hemispherical device**  
**descended from the ceiling.**  

Though Peter and Levy were **unconscious,**  
their **eyes darted rapidly beneath closed lids.**  

Outside,  
The Ring **rotated in perfect silence.**  

Its **interior was fully illuminated,**  
and every **sealed door had opened.**  

At long last,  
The Ring had **fully awakened.**  

But…  

On the opposite side of The Ring,  
Drake and Irene had **just docked.**  

Smirking **wickedly,**  
they stepped inside.  

"Hahaha!!!"  

"Kuhahaha!!!"  

As if they had **just uncovered**  
the **ultimate secret,**  

the two **laughed hysterically**  
as they walked toward Peter and Levy.

# 35. The GemSTON Knights <br>
<br><br><br>

"You, Keith… I will **never** forgive you!"  

Gerald's **tears flowed** as he drew his sword.  

A **Rothschild spy,**  
who had come to deliver regular reports,  
stood in **uneasy silence.**  

The information he brought today  
was that **Keith of the Templar Order**  
had **killed Johan—Gerald's brother.**  

"That bastard…  
He's the one who did this to me…  
and he's the one who **killed my brother.**"  

Gerald clenched his fists,  
staring at the **burn scars** on his body.  

"And what's even more shocking…  
Cesar has **returned.**  

And now,  
he **leads the Templar Order**  
and is **marching toward us.**"  

"What?!"  

Gerald's **eyes widened.**  

"Why **won't** that bastard **stay dead?!**"  

A terrifying thought flashed through his mind—  

Avignon would **fall.**  

It was only a **matter of time.**  

"They're coming for the **Pope's GemSTONEs.**  

And the **treasures of the Church.**"  

After **seeing off the spy,**  
Gerald climbed to the **top of the papal tower.**  

He gazed across the **vast fields**  
surrounding Avignon.  

"This land…  
will soon be **drenched in blood.**"  

Hearing the news,  
**Father Gregory** stood beside him,  
his face clouded with concern.  

Then—  

"Gerald, look over there!"  

Gregory suddenly **shouted.**  

A **small armed force** was approaching.  

"Only about **200 soldiers…**  

That's **too few**  
for a **Templar invasion.**"  

"Wait…"  

Gerald stared through his **spyglass.**  

Then, his **grim expression**  
**broke into a smile.**  

"That's **Max!**  

He's bringing **reinforcements!**"  

At the **front of the formation,**  
Max **marched boldly,**  
his **chest puffed with confidence.**  

Behind him—  

The **heroes of the Battle of Morgarten.**  

**Supreme Commander Werner,**  
the **Celtic twin warriors, Henkel and Aidan,**  
and the **mystical illusionist, Gideon Levi.**  

One by one,  
their **familiar faces** entered Gerald's view.  

The moment Max had heard Gerald's call for help,  
he had **gathered his forces**  

and **marched for 15 days**  
from Switzerland to Avignon.  

Their **entire force numbered 200.**  

"Our Swiss warriors **always repay our debts.**  

And we **never retreat** from battle!"  

As the **city gates opened,**  
Commander Werner **stroked his beard and shouted.**  

They were **only 200 strong…**  

But **each one**  
was a **seasoned war hero.**  

They were immediately assigned  
to the **seven GemSTON Knights.**  

That night,  
a **joyous celebration** was held.  

"Hah!  

We **don't know**  
how many men they're bringing,  

but with **this group,**  
I'd say we have a **chance!**"  

"Even at **Morgarten,**  
we stood **together**  
and defeated the **Imperial army!**  

Hahaha!"  

The morale **was soaring.**  

Then—  

Gerald suddenly **stood on the table**  
and **raised his voice.**  

"Do not **underestimate** the **Templar Order!**"  

The hall **fell silent.**  

Even **Commander Werner**  
**nodded gravely.**  

"In all of the Empire,  
there is **no army**  
more **battle-hardened** than theirs.  

I would know…  
**I was once one of them.**"  

As he finished speaking,  

Gerald **drew a dagger**  
and **hurled it.**  

**WHOOSH!**  

The blade **sliced through the air,**  
splitting a **candle in half**  
before **burying itself in the wall.**  

"On top of that…"  

Gerald's **voice hardened.**  

"We can no longer **use**  
the power of the **GemSTONEs.**"  

All eyes turned to Maria.  

She instinctively **hid her burned hands.**  

"Maria,  
you don't need to **hide.**  

You saved **me.**  

Now, it's **my turn**  
to **protect you.**"  

Gerald clenched his fists.  

One by one,  
the warriors **cheered**  
and **pounded their fists on the table.**  

Maria's father **climbed onto the table.**  

"Maria **must stay** with the Pope.  

The rest of us…  

We **fight to the death!**"  

His **eyes blazed**  
with the **determination**  
of a man who had **accepted death.**  

"YES!"  

"If the Templars **kill us**  
and take the **GemSTONEs,**  

they **will invade Switzerland next!**"  

"YES!!!"  

The hall **roared**  
with the **spirit of warriors.**  

Maria's father returned to his seat.  

Max leaned over and whispered.  

"Joseph…  
I'll be honest.  

I don't **want** to die.  

I'm scared."  

Max, the **largest and strongest man in the room,**  
was **filled with fear.**  

In contrast,  
Maria's father, **thin and wiry,**  
remained **calm.**  

He **grabbed Max's hair**  
with both hands and laughed.  

"Don't worry.  

**I'll protect you.**"  

The room **erupted in laughter.**  

.  
.  
.  

"The Pope has **summoned everyone.**"  

Father Gregory relayed the message  
to the **warriors of Morgarten.**  

For **his safety,**  
the Pope had **moved his residence**  
to the **highest tower** of Avignon.  

As the **GemSTON Knights** gathered,  
the Pope **prayed** for each one,  
**holding their hands.**  

Then, Gregory **handed out necklaces**  
engraved with the **Papal seal.**  

Each necklace had a **GemSTONE embedded**  
in the center.  

"The **two crossed keys**  
represent the Pope's authority  
over **Heaven and Earth.**  

And before them is a **shield.**  

It is a **symbol of protection.**"  

Maria **smiled.**  

"By placing a **GemSTONE in the shield,**  
we become **even stronger protectors.**"  

Max scratched his head.  

"Why are you giving **something so valuable** to us?"  

"From this day forward,  
you are officially **knights of the Pope.**"  

Gregory **draped**  
a **crimson cappa magna**  
over the Pope's shoulders.  

The **aging Pope coughed**  
as he spoke.  

"You have all **sworn to fight to the death.**  

This is **all I can do**  
to support you."  

He slowly **stepped onto the platform.**  

"From now on,  
you are officially **the GemSTON Knights.**"  

One by one,  
he **bestowed** knightly **titles.**  

Each title was **unique,**  
representing their **specific roles**  
in the battle.  

Henkel received the **Linker** title.  

Aidan received the **Lancer** title.  

Gideon Levi received the **Healer** title.  

Gerald received the **Archer** title.  

Max received the **Halberd** title.  

Joseph, Maria's father,  
received the **Joker** title.  

The last to be knighted—  

Maria.  

She was given the title **Guardian.**  

Her role was **the most important,**  
yet she was knighted **last.**  

A reminder—  
she was not their **leader,**  
but their **source of power.**  

Beside her,  
Tori, the **captured automaton,**  
watched with **bright, curious eyes.**  

As Maria **bowed to the Pope,**  
Tori **mimicked her actions.**  

Laughter **filled the room.**  

The **shadow of death** loomed over Avignon.  

But for tonight…  

They embraced **happiness.**  

.  
.  
.  

"Maria."  

"Yes?"  

"Cesar…  
His arrogance makes him careless,  
but **never underestimate him.**"  

The Pope adjusted his robe.  

"That **thing…**  

It is **not human.**  

I have **seen** his body **with my own eyes.**"
