“The Empire needs power, Cesar.”

Leopold I of the House of Habsburg expressed his frustration to Cesar.    

“I understand.”    
Cesar poured wine into a crystal glass on the banquet table, offering it to Leopold.    

“Though we are based in a small Swiss village,    
I know well that Your Highness, Prince Leopold—legitimate scion of the noble Habsburg line—intends to unify the entire Empire.”    

Leopold was easily swayed by flattery.    
“You do get me.    
The West Franks have formed a unified empire and keep growing stronger, but here in East Francia, we remain divided.    
I can't sleep at night.”    

As soon as the Emperor finished, Cesar slowly turned around.    

They already had enough power.

Amid the evening banquet set in the imperial courtyard, Cesar raised his wineglass,    
then walked over to the crates stacked near a poplar tree.    
In the darkness, Gemstones glowed, reflecting off his face.    

“Care to take a look?”    

Next to the Gemstone crate stood a young Celtic priestess, blindfolded, with her hands and feet bound to a post.    
Cesar fiddled with her Gemstone necklace, tore it off, and placed it on a blacksmith's anvil.    

Her lips trembled like ripples in water.    

Amused, Cesar circled her, then suddenly drove a knife into her arm.    
A bright gush of blood spurted forth.    
At her shriek, the Gemstone pendant glowed crimson,    
slowly melting the steel anvil supporting it until rivulets of molten metal splattered.    

“If you want to live, fuel those flames,” Cesar whispered.    
She shook her head in terror, saying she knew nothing.    

Cesar picked up a torch from the banquet area and tossed it onto the firewood under the post where the priestess was bound.    
Sparks roared up, swallowing the logs.    

She howled as the flames engulfed her.    
The more she screamed, the hotter the Gemstone pendant on the anvil burned.    
In moments, the steel anvil was reduced to seething molten iron.    
Her body burned away to ash, leaving only the smell of molten metal and an eerie silence.    

“Sigh… The trouble is that we can't properly extract this power.    
We can't just keep burning priestesses to get it.”    

Cesar nudged the charred remains with his foot.    

He looked toward the sky.    

'Our family has a long history of witch-hunting,'    
he thought, finally sipping his wine.    

The Emperor gazed at him hopefully while sipping his own.    
"These days, Gemstones often glow on their own, you know. I sense them nearby."    

The Emperor nodded.    
"You're right. We've collected enough Gemstones over the years.    
All that remains is to find someone able to wield them."    

"But how long will we harass these Celtic priestesses?    
From what I can tell, Celtic witches just use Gemstones for fortune-telling; they can't fully unleash power."    

At the Emperor's lament, Cesar raised his glass again.    
"You recall that well-known Jewish jeweler we framed and exiled from Rome a few months ago?    
Rumor says that family's women can use Gemstone power. I'm the one who set them up. Hahaha."    

Grabbing a nearby torch, Cesar's eyes glittered more intensely.    
"Once they're in danger, they'll have no choice but to call upon the Gemstone's power.    
So I planted spies to watch them."    
He paused, locking eyes with Leopold.    

"Right on cue, we received word from Grand Duke Cheringen.    
In the dead of night, they used Gemstones for lighting,    
and in Bern, after being exiled, they fought a local resident    
and beat a man twice their size with nothing but Gemstone force."    

A spark lit the Emperor's gaze.    
"So you exiled those Jewish folks for that reason?    
Quite clever, Cesar."    

Cesar set out for Bern.    
"No need to bother Celtic priestesses anymore. I'll confirm it myself."
