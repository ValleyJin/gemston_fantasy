"My sweet child."    

She spoke as though she already knew Maria would come.    
Grandmother had been waiting with the lights on.    
But they weren't candles.    

"My pendant has been glowing since early evening."    
Grandmother removed the necklace from her own neck and placed it around Maria's.    
"I always believed a day like this would come, but I've never seen it shine so brightly before."    

It was a silver necklace,    
the chain's design was simple, but it held a large greenish-blue Gemstone pendant.    
Strangely, it lit the dark room as if by its own light.    

"I planned to pass it on when your mother had a daughter, but she never displayed any sign of power, so I kept it."    
"Huh?"    

Maria's big eyes sparkled, reflecting the Gemstone's glow.

A long time ago,    
the gods fought each other in constant war.    

Eventually they grew weary    
and, to stop any single deity from ruling the universe,    
they agreed to divide their powers equally.    

They sealed any surpassing power within a Gemstone,    
so that no one could break the pact.    

They then entrusted it to the goddess Hera, who had remained neutral in every conflict.    
Hera fashioned the Gemstone into a pendant    
and hung it around the neck of her pet raccoon Tori.

But the god of darkness broke the oath and sneaked in to kidnap Tori,    
trying to extract that vast force from the Gemstone around Tori's neck.    

Hera realized the scheme    
and shattered the Gemstone at once,    
scattering its energy throughout the universe.    

The greedy dark god    
was still roaming about, searching for its fragments.

Grandmother, too, had once thought it was just a legend,    
but now she knew it was real.    

"Maria, you must be careful.    
The power of the Gemstone is immense, but it can also be dangerous."    

Maria nodded, understanding the gravity of her grandmother's words.    

"I will, Grandmother. I promise to use it wisely."    

The night was silent, save for the soft glow of the Gemstone illuminating the room.    
Maria knew that her life was about to change forever.
