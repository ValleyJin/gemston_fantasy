"My dear child."  

It was as if she already knew Maria would come.  
Grandmother had been waiting with the light on.  
But it wasn’t candlelight.  

  
“My necklace has been glowing since early evening.”  
She took off the necklace and placed it around Maria’s neck.  
“I always knew this day would come,  
but I’ve never seen it shine so brightly before.”  

  
It was a silver necklace.  
The chain was simple and rough,  
but a large, greenish-blue gemstone pendant hung from it,  
emitting a mysterious light that illuminated the dark room.  

  
“I intended to pass it down if I had a daughter,  
but strangely, your mother never showed any ability,  
so I kept it.”  

  
“What?”  

  
Maria’s large eyes reflected the gemstone’s light,  
twinkling like stars.  

  
.  
.  
.  

  
Long ago.  
The gods were at war.  

  
But they grew weary of the endless battles,  
and to ensure that no one among them  
could rule the universe alone,  
they made their powers equal.  

  
To prevent anyone from ever wielding  
greater strength than the rest,  
they sealed their excess power inside gemstones—  
the GemSTONs.  

  
And they entrusted them  
to the goddess Hera,  
who had remained neutral in all wars.  
Hera fashioned the gemstones into a necklace  
and placed it around the neck of her pet raccoon, Tori.

But the god of darkness broke the pact,  
sneaking in and kidnapping Tori.  
He tried to draw out the immense power  
sealed within the GemSTON around Tori’s neck.  

  
Hera realized what had happened,  
and in an instant,  
she shattered the gemstone into countless pieces,  
scattering its power across the universe.  

  
The greedy god of darkness  
is still searching for the fragments of the GemSTON  
to this day.

Even this grandmother once thought  
it was just a legend.  
Like a lullaby.  

  
.  
.  
.  

  
Grandmother gently stroked Maria’s hair  
as she continued her story.  

  
“I was just about your age  
when it happened.  
Like any other day,  
I had gone to the mine  
to bring food to my father.”  

  
Grandmother remembered that day clearly.  
As she carefully walked through the mine,  
she suddenly noticed  
that her skirt was soaked in blood.  
Back then,  
she hadn’t known what it meant  
to become a woman.  

  
Panicking,  
she hid herself in a small tunnel and cried.  
She wept in the pitch-black darkness,  
too ashamed to step outside  
with her blood-stained skirt and shoes.  

  
Then, like a candle being lit,  
the tunnel began to glow.  
Light seeped through the cracks in the rocks,  
illuminating the mine from every direction.  
It felt as if the universe itself  
was celebrating her coming of age.  

  
Surrounded by the glow,  
the young girl dug frantically at the cracks,  
grabbing fistfuls of the brilliant gemstones  
without even realizing what she was doing.  

  
“My father, waiting for his meal,  
eventually came looking for me.  
I held up my hands,  
full of shining stones,  
and asked,  
‘Are these GemSTONs?’  
Ha ha ha.”  

  
But for Grandmother,  
that was the first and last time  
she ever made a GemSTON shine.  

  
“That day,  
I picked the brightest one  
and made it into this pendant.”  
Grandmother smiled as she looked  
at the pendant now resting on Maria’s chest.  

  
She had waited through her daughter’s adolescence,  
expecting the power to manifest.  
It was, after all,  
a gift passed down through the women in their family.  

  
But nothing ever happened to Maria’s mother.  

  
Grandmother took Maria’s hand  
and placed it on the pendant.  

  
“If you can make it glow,  
you must also learn how to extinguish it.”  

  
For Maria,  
this wasn’t difficult.  

  
Even before leaving home,  
she had already snuffed out  
the glow of the gemstone pouch in the carriage.  

  
She wasn’t exactly sure how she had done it.  

  
She had simply thought clearly to herself,  
*If they keep shining,  
someone will take them.  
I wish they would stop glowing.*  

  
Maria proudly showed her skill to Grandmother.  
The pendant’s glow dimmed,  
then flared up,  
grew weaker,  
then stronger again—  
following Maria’s will exactly.  

  
The mountain village of Bern  
was bathed in the early morning light.  

  
.  
.  
.  

  
“Heh… I knew it.”  

  
Max swept up the now-dull pebbles  
Maria had left behind.  

  
They had illuminated his tavern all night,  
but by dawn,  
they were nothing more than ordinary stones.  

  
“They didn’t even last two days,  
let alone three.”  

  
Hoisting his halberd over his back,  
he marched off to settle the score  
from the night before.  

  
The morning sunlight  
gleamed off his weapon,  
a cold, sharp blue.  

  
As he strode toward Maria’s house,  
villagers joined in behind him,  
eager for the spectacle.  

  
Maria’s father,  
hearing of Max’s approach,  
rummaged through the carriage  
and pulled out an old sword.  

  
“I don’t think I’ll win.”  
His hands trembled,  
but his gaze was steady.  

  
Andrea, his eyes brimming with tears,  
stood in front of the door.  

  
“Brother,  
can’t we just run away again?”  

  
But where would they go?  
They had already fled once.  

  
With a bitter smile,  
Maria’s father placed a hand on Andrea’s shoulder.  

  
“If I back down here,  
our family will…”  

  
The door suddenly swung open,  
and Maria strode inside.  
She held up the pendant  
that Grandmother had given her.  

  
“Father,  
you will not lose.”  

  
Her father was taken aback.  
She wasn’t a child  
who naively believed he was invincible.  
And yet,  
he could feel  
her absolute certainty.  

  
Maria’s father stepped into the street,  
awaiting Max.  

  
“When Max appears,  
swing your sword first.”  

  
Max appeared at the top of the hill,  
his halberd slung over his shoulder.  

  
Maria clenched her fists,  
gazing intently at his weapon.  

  
“Now!”  

  
A blue flash of lightning shot forward,  
disintegrating Max’s halberd  
and demolishing the bell tower behind him.  

  
“Ding… dong… ding… dong…”  

  
The bell rolled down the hill,  
its echoes spreading through the valley.

Maria’s father’s sword,  
with the gemstone pendant wrapped around its hilt,  
still glowed fiercely.  

  
“I… I surrender!”  

  
Max,  
his face pale,  
offered no resistance.  

  
Maria’s father cast his gaze over the crowd.  

  
.  
.  
.  

  
No one dared meet his eyes.  
One by one,  
they turned and fled.  

  
From that day on,  
no one ever challenged Maria’s father again.  

  
On the contrary,  
when he used the GemSTON's glow  
to illuminate his work in the mines instead of candles,  
people started asking for their own.
