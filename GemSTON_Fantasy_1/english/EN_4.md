“My sweet child.”<br>

She spoke as though she already knew Maria would come. <br>
Grandmother had been waiting with the lights on. <br>
But they weren’t candles. <br>

“My pendant has been glowing since early evening.” <br>
Grandmother removed the necklace from her own neck and placed it around Maria’s. <br>
“I always believed a day like this would come, but I’ve never seen it shine so brightly before.” <br>

It was a silver necklace, <br>
the chain’s design was simple, but it held a large greenish-blue Gemstone pendant. <br>
Strangely, it lit the dark room as if by its own light. <br>

“I planned to pass it on when your mother had a daughter, but she never displayed any sign of power, so I kept it.” <br>
“Huh?” <br>

Maria’s big eyes sparkled, reflecting the Gemstone’s glow. <br>

A long time ago,<br>
the gods fought each other in constant war.<br>

Eventually they grew weary <br>
and, to stop any single deity from ruling the universe, <br>
they agreed to divide their powers equally.<br>

They sealed any surpassing power within a Gemstone, <br>
so that no one could break the pact.<br>

They then entrusted it to the goddess Hera, who had remained neutral in every conflict.<br>
Hera fashioned the Gemstone into a pendant <br>
and hung it around the neck of her pet raccoon Tori.<br>
<br>

<br><br><br>

But the god of darkness broke the oath and sneaked in to kidnap Tori, <br>
trying to extract that vast force from the Gemstone around Tori’s neck. <br>

Hera realized the scheme <br>
and shattered the Gemstone at once,<br>
scattering its energy throughout the universe.<br>

The greedy dark god <br>
was still roaming about, searching for its fragments.<br>

<br><br><br>

Grandmother, too, had once thought it was just a legend, <br>
like a lullaby.<br>

.<br>
.<br>
.<br>

She gently ran her hand through Maria’s hair, continuing her story. <br>

“I was about your age, just starting adolescence myself, <br>
and went to bring a meal to my father, who worked the mines.”<br>

She remembered that day vividly. <br>
Feeling her way through the tunnels, <br>
she suddenly realized her skirt was stained with blood— <br>
back then, she had no idea what it meant to become a woman. <br>

Panicking, she hid in a small side tunnel and wept. <br>
It was pitch-black, and she cried, <br>
unable to emerge with her skirt and shoes soaked in blood. <br>

Then, as though someone lit a candle, the tunnel grew bright.<br>
Everywhere in the mine glimmered, <br>
light leaking through cracks in the broken rock. <br>
It felt like a celebration of her coming of age.<br>
Enveloped by that glow, the little girl started digging out the shining stones.<br>

“My father finally came searching and found me, <br>
and I was standing there with my hands full of glowing gems, asking if they were real Gemstones, haha.”<br>

That was the first and last day Grandmother said she ever caused a Gemstone to shine so brightly. <br>

“I took the brightest one and made it into this pendant.” <br>
She glanced at the pendant now on Maria’s neck, smiling. <br>

She had once waited for Maria’s mother to reach adolescence, expecting this inherited power to appear. <br>
But nothing had happened to her mother. <br>
Now the old woman took Maria’s hands and placed them over the pendant. <br>

“If you turned it on, you can turn it off too.”<br>

For Maria, that wasn’t so difficult. <br>
She had done the same earlier this evening, shutting off the glow of the pebbles in the wagon. <br>

Maria herself barely understood how she deactivated the Gemstone. <br>

Perhaps it was simply a clear mental focus: <br>
“I hope it wouldn’t glow so others might not take it.” <br>
And just like that, the light faded.<br>

Maria showed off for Grandmother, <br>
turning the pendant’s glow off and on, weakening it or brightening it, <br>
exactly in sync with her inner thoughts. <br>

Outside, dawn approached in the Bern mountain village. <br>

.<br>
.<br>
.<br>

“Heh heh… I thought so.”<br>
Max was busily scooping up all the pebbles Maria had left behind in his tavern. <br>

Through the night, these stones had illuminated his place like candles, <br>
but by daybreak, they no longer glowed, returning to mere rocks. <br>

“So it didn’t even last two days, let alone three.”<br>
He hefted a halberd on his back, determined to finish yesterday’s fight. <br>

Sunlight reflected sharply on the blade’s edge. <br>

In the early morning, Max marched briskly toward Maria’s home, <br>
people along the way tagging behind, hoping for a spectacle.<br>

They heard Max was coming, <br>
so Maria’s father dug out an old sword from the wagon. <br>

“I’m not sure I can win,” <br>
he admitted, trembling slightly. <br>
But his gaze at Uncle Andrea was calm. <br>

From childhood, he had cared deeply for his youngest brother. <br>
Andrea stood in tears, blocking the doorway. <br>

“Brother, why not just flee again?” <br>

They had already fled Rome, only to land here. Where else would they go? <br>
He gave a wry smile, resting a hand on Andrea’s shoulder.<br>
“If I back down now, our whole family is lost…”<br>

Just then, the door swung open, revealing Maria entering with self-assured steps. <br>
She held up the pendant Grandmother had just given her. <br>

“Maria! So Grandmother finally passed it down, did she?” <br>
Her father had waited for this moment, hugging her tight. <br>

“She’s already grown up… I still remember when she was an infant,” <br>
he murmured, tears sliding down his lined cheeks.<br>

But Maria neither looked at him nor cried nor spoke. <br>
She simply took the Gemstone pendant from around her neck and tied it to his sword hilt. <br>

“Dad, I don’t believe you’ll lose.” <br>

Her father felt flustered. <br>
He thought she was past the age of believing “Dad is the strongest,” but realized she meant it sincerely.<br>

“Dad!”<br>
Maria’s big eyes locked on his.<br>

“Go outside and wait for Max. If you see him from afar, swing your sword at him.”<br>

She had never sounded so firm before. Almost as if in a daze, <br>
he stepped out into the street and waited in the center for Max to appear. <br>

“Once you spot him coming, slash toward him with the blade.”<br>

Sure enough, Max soon showed up on the hill, lugging a massive halberd on his back. <br>

With a desperate glance toward Maria, <br>
he saw her clasping the pendant in both hands, eyes locked on Max’s halberd.<br>

“Now!”<br>

At her command, the father’s rusty sword swung toward Max. <br>

Suddenly, the Gemstone’s fierce blue radiance erupted in a blade-like surge, <br>
disintegrating Max’s halberd and <br>
carving through the bell tower behind him.<br>

“Ding… dong… ding… dong…”<br>

The old bell clattered down, <br>
tumbling across the valley with a deafening clang, <br>
shattering into pieces that crashed through a wooden fence and strewing broken bricks along the hillside path.<br>

<br><br><br>

Sheep and cattle peacefully grazing in a nearby field bleated in terror, <br>
bolting over the ridge.<br>

Her father’s sword. <br>

The pendant Maria had tied around its hilt still crackled with rage, <br>
pulsing a bright azure glow. <br>

“I yield!” <br>
Max cried out as the father advanced, blade still raised, <br>
fear gripping him too strongly to say anything else. <br>

His searing gaze swept over the onlookers,<br>
and they all froze, too terrified even to change expression. <br>

Stumbling back in silent panic, they finally turned and fled down the road. <br>

In Maria’s memory, <br>
no one picked a fight with her father again after that day. <br>

Instead, <br>
since he used Gemstones for light instead of candles while mining, <br>
villagers began asking him for one as well. <br>
