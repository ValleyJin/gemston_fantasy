"Peter, news of the accident at CERN is spreading across social media.  
Not only fire trucks, but radiation decontamination teams have also been dispatched."  

"Let’s hide the armor first and deal with it later."  

Dr. Levy and Peter moved quickly, returning the **armor** to the basement of **Cafe Marta**.  
Their movements were perfectly synchronized.  

"I never imagined that such a code was hidden within Maria’s fingerprints."  

Dr. Levy suddenly became curious.  

"Peter, why do you think this fingerprint pattern appears **only in the women** of our family?"  

"I'm not entirely sure, Grandpa.  
But I have a theory."  

    

Late at night, past midnight, the only light inside **Cafe Marta** came from the dim glow of a candle.  

Peter tried to explain in a way that Dr. Levy could easily understand.  

"It must be something exclusive to the **female lineage** in our DNA."  

"Does such a thing exist?"  

"Yes. **Mitochondria.**"  

Dr. Levy’s eyes lit up with interest.  

"If I had to guess, the radiation emitted when the **GemSTONE glows** caused a **mutation** in Grandma Maria’s **mitochondrial DNA**."  

"What does that have to do with fingerprints?"  

"This part is just my speculation, but…"  

According to Peter, the **mutated mitochondria** likely affected other genes responsible for **fingerprint formation.**  

"The **WNT** and **BMP genes** determine the ridges and grooves of fingerprints.  
The **EDAR gene** controls the size and spacing of the ridges."  

"So in the end, a mutation in the **mitochondrial DNA**, which is passed down maternally, created this **unique fingerprint**."  

"Yes. It’s fascinating. It feels like someone **deliberately left us clues,** guiding us toward using this energy."  

"Haha, looks like genetics runs strong in the **Kandel family**.  
So, **biotech** is in our blood, huh?"  

Dr. Levy smiled proudly at Peter.  

    

"This old man may not know the **secrets of the GemSTONE**,  
but I do know **one thing.**"  

"What is it?"  

"I know **who sent this energy.**"  

"...What???"  

Peter looked at Dr. Levy, wide-eyed.  

A **large screen** slowly descended from the ceiling of **Cafe Marta**.  

Dr. Levy entered a code into his **wireless keyboard** and accessed **SpaceX’s Starlink network**.  

The screen displayed a **massive ring-like structure** operating at **Lagrange Point L3**.  

At the bottom of the screen, a single word was displayed in **bold letters.**  

**The Ring.**  

Around The Ring, **space shuttles** bearing the **De Morgan insignia** were actively working on the structure.  

"Grandpa, so this is what you’ve been working on your whole life at **De Morgan**?"  

"It wasn’t easy.  
We were always short on manpower, funding, and, most of all…  
It had to be done **in secret.**"  

Dr. Levy showed Peter a **photo from his retirement.**  

"The **Rothschild family** helped us a lot, and **U.S. intelligence agencies** provided major funding."  

The photo showed **a hundred people gathered in Houston’s mission control center**,  
celebrating as if they had just completed a historic mission.  

"When I was about your age, I **accidentally discovered The Ring.**"  

On the **Cafe Marta** screen, The Ring slowly rotated in space.  

"Then… is The Ring an **interstellar object** that traveled here at **lightspeed**?"  

"That’s right.  
For the past **40 years**, we’ve secretly built a **lunar orbital station**  
and launched **shuttles** from there to **Lagrange Point L4**."  

Dr. Levy displayed **archived photos and videos** of The Ring’s **interior and exterior.**  

"It’s as if this structure was designed **with us in mind.**  

It has a **control room,**  
a **docking station,**  
even **seats**—as if **waiting for someone.**"  

Peter pointed at the **sharp spires** surrounding The Ring.  

"What about those pointed **towers** evenly spaced around it?"  

"You have **good eyes,** Peter. Haha."  

These **energy transmission spires** were the key to everything.  

Anything positioned at **Lagrange Point L4** maintains a constant distance from Earth.  

When they first arrived, The Ring had **completely drained its energy**,  
but it had been **slowly recharging from Earth.**  

"We found out that **Earth had been sending energy to The Ring.**  

Not a large amount—just enough for it to survive."  

Peter’s curiosity peaked.  

"So where on Earth was this energy coming from?"  

Dr. Levy **grinned.**  

"Take a guess, Peter."  

"…**Cafe Marta?**"  

"Haha, you’re catching on."  

Dr. Levy **patted Peter’s head, laughing heartily.**  

"That was something **DNI agents** discovered.  
They were the ones who **found this basement** beneath **Cafe Marta.**"  

"They must have gone through all our **family records and artifacts** here, right?"  

"Of course.  
They even took a **sample of the GemSTONE** and analyzed it,  
but to them, it was just a **shiny rock.**  
They couldn’t figure out the truth."  

"Ah…  
So that’s why they **reached out** to you."  

"Exactly.  

All the **key pieces** were in our family’s hands.  
They decided **to let us lead the project,** providing funding and support."  

Dr. Levy stood up from the sofa and faced the **wall-sized screen.**  

"We already knew the **legends.**  
So I tried looking at The Ring **from a different perspective.**"  

He poured himself a **beer** and smiled at Peter.  

"We stopped **trying to understand The Ring** from **our** perspective."  

"Then whose perspective?"  

"The perspective of **whoever sent it.**  

What did they **want us to do**?"  

NASA had traced The Ring’s **trajectory**,  
leading back to a **star system 1,400 light-years away.**  

**Kepler-452b.**  

"Think about it, Peter.  

**1,400 years ago,** someone launched The Ring toward Earth **at lightspeed.**  

And for the past **1,400 years,**  
they’ve been **sending energy** to power it once it arrived."  

"Carrying that energy **onboard** would have made it too heavy."  

"Exactly."  

"Wait…  
**1,400 years ago**…  

That’s when **Grandma Maria** was alive."  

    

For a long moment, both men **fell silent.**  

"Then…  
what is The Ring **for**?"  

Peter’s **expression darkened.**  

"One thing is certain:  
it’s not meant **to attack Earth.**  
If that were the case, it would have done so already."  

Through years of **NASA investigations**,  
one conclusion became clear—The Ring was **not hostile.**  

Though its **technology** remained unknown,  
nothing inside appeared **designed for destruction.**  

Multiple **manned expeditions** had docked at The Ring.  

Inside, they found **rotating gravity modules,  
strange chairs, and unfamiliar control panels.**  

Though the technology seemed **old**,  
it was made of **light yet highly elastic materials.**  

At its core, The Ring was simply **a massive, rotating structure.**  

Dr. Levy exhaled.  

"They sent The Ring because they **wanted to understand us.**  

That’s all."  

Peter’s **eyes widened.**  

"Then… it’s a **communication device**?"  

"Exactly."  

"But with **whom**?"  

Dr. Levy leaned back, exhaling smoke from his **cigar.**  

"Just sit in that **chair,** Peter.  

There are no **buttons, no controls.**  

It’s as if they’re **waiting for us to respond.**"
