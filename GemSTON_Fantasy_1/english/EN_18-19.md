A bank owned by the Rothschild family, located in Venice, Italy.  

Luxury cars arrived one after another through the narrow alleyways, each carrying a distinguished guest.  
They stepped out and entered a private elevator, descending deep into a concealed underground vault.  

From the top floor, a secretary observed the proceedings before turning to inform the chairman that everything was ready.  
The elderly chairman, moving with difficulty, made his way to the vault.  

At his command, the vault doors opened.  
Inside a climate-controlled, transparent case lay the upper half of a metal suit of armor.  

It was just as the legend describedâ€”split perfectly into two symmetrical halves.  

"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the armor once worn by our ancestor, Sir Gerald."  
The chairman introduced the artifact with pride.

In the bright light, faint fingerprint-like ridges could be seen etched into its surface.  
A steward carefully carried a separate piece of the armor forward.  

On a large monitor, the proposal submitted to the DAO by Dr. Levi was displayed.  
A young successor to the Rothschild legacy stepped forward and entered a security code.  

During World War II, to escape Nazi looters, the armor had been temporarily entrusted to the Davidoff family in Russia.  
After the war, the Rothschilds retrieved it and kept it in their Venetian vault for safekeeping.  
Now, the official request for its return to the Levi family in Switzerland had been logged in the system.  

The elderly chairman, wearing thick magnifying glasses, read the decrypted request aloud:  

"...  
They who bestowed upon us the power of the gemstones have been discovered on the outer rim of our solar system.  
This entity, now known as 'The Ring,' is a vast circular construct.  

Our mission is to return the gemstone energy to this structure and activate it.  

This is the moment we have awaited for a thousand years,  
..."  

The designated delivery location was Cafe Marta.  

The family elders gathered to vote on the request.  
Unanimously, they raised their hands in agreement.  

Thus, on the DAO ledger, the Rothschild family's share of the transaction was officially recorded.  

"Chairman, it has been decades since the last agenda item in the Gemstone Knights' DAO."  

"Cough... Times have changed, but beyond utilizing blockchain networks, our goals remain the same."  

"Our DAO shares were issued based on our gemstone reserves, correct?"  

"Precisely. The amount stored in our underground vaults corresponds exactly to our shareholdings.  
Of course, it is likely that Cafe Marta holds a far greater reserve.  
But our collection is still significant."  

The metal armor underwent its final inspection before being placed in a custom-made secure transport case.  

Escorted by a heavily armed convoy, the artifact departed for Cafe Marta.

# 19. Return to Obwalden   
      

May 3, 1315.  

"Tomorrow is the deadline, yet I remain uneasy."  
Maria's father consulted a Jewish rabbi in Obwalden.  

"The gold from Uri and Schwyz is due to arrive, correct?"  
"Yes, Rabbi. Their commitment is unwavering."  
"Then what is your concern?"  
"It is the involvement of the Rothschild family in safeguarding the gold that troubles me."  

The rabbi poured a cup of warm milk and listened intently.  

Maria's father elaborated.  

"It makes sense to entrust the gold to financial experts like the Rothschilds.  
But can we truly trust them?"  

"After all, they, too, are Jewish, are they not?"  
"Yes, and their expertise in finance and trade is unparalleled.  
To them, gemstones themselves might even be seen as an investment asset."  

"If this deal succeeds, their influence in Swiss banking will only grow."  
The rabbi nodded, seeing the broader picture.  

But from Maria's father's perspective, what assurance did they have that this trust would be honored?  

"Love."  
"Excuse me?"  
"Do you know what the strongest kind of alliance is? Marriage."  
The rabbi's response was simple but profound.  

Maria's father burst into laughter.  

"Think about it. Look at the Habsburgs.  
Through marriage, they have placed their rulers on thrones across Europe."  

But Maria's father hesitated.  
"Maria is still too young... And why would such a prestigious family consider a marriage alliance with us?"  

"Who knows? If it is God's will, it may happen."  
The rabbi gazed thoughtfully at the sky.  

"Do you not remember? The night Maria left on her pilgrimage,  
our entire council betrayed us, nearly leading to our deaths."  

"Had it not been for Werner's quick response, we would all have perished..."  

"God's will is revealed when we are at our most desperate."  

The quiet night passed, and finally, the dawn of May 4 arrived.  
The sky was clear, the breeze warm with the arrival of spring.  

Early that morning, carriages carrying gold from Uri and Schwyz arrived.  
By noon, Maria's pilgrimage party returned, now joined by dozens of warriors from across Northern Europe.  

Maria rushed to her father.  

"Father, I must introduce someone to you!"  

She scanned the crowd for Gerald. But he was nowhere to be found.  

"Maria, it is wonderful news that you have received a proposal.  
If only your mother were here to share in this joy..."  

Maria held her father's hand tightly as he wept.  

At noon, a grand feast was prepared in Werner's military camp.  

Then, trumpets blared as the Rothschild delegation arrived.  

Dressed in elegant finery, they stood out among the Swiss villagers.  

A young man stepped forward and introduced himself formally.  

Maria's father, overwhelmed with nerves, struggled to speak.  

"Ahem... I... I welcome you..."  

Before he could finish, Maria's voice rang out.  

"Gerald!"  

It was him.  

Maria, who had been searching frantically, was stunned to see Gerald among the delegation.  

He smiled.  

The solemn diplomatic reception suddenly transformed into a grand engagement celebration.
