# 13. The Vanished Metal Armor   
      

The muffled sounds of trams passing overhead and the murmur of tourists echoed faintly.   
The basement of Café Marta.   

When Peter stepped into the basement with Dr. Levi,   
he was surprised by how bright it was.   

Storage cabinets filled with gemstone boxes lined the walls,   
illuminating the space like daylight.   

"What's that sound of flowing water?"   
"Peter, this basement is lower than the Aare River. If we don't keep pumping out the water, it'll flood."   
"These days, you can just use an electric pump, but how did they do it back then?"   
"Even now, electricity isn't necessary. The gemstones themselves keep the water out."   
Dr. Levi pointed to the drainage channel running along the bottom of the basement walls.   
"Underneath, gemstones are boiling the water, creating convection currents that push the water out."   

The deeper they moved into the basement, the brighter the light became.   
Stronger gemstones of various colors were placed in the center.   

Ancient parchment documents were scattered around,   
along with weapons once wielded by the Gemstone Knights—lances, shields, longbows, crossbows, and suits of armor.   
Most impressive was the grand banner, emblazoned with the emblem of the Gemstone Knights, said to have been bestowed by Pope Clement V.   

But on the opposite wall, though its colors had faded,   
a magnificent red cloak adorned with golden buttons hung unfurled.   
"Impressive, isn't it? This belonged to Cesar. It says here that the Gemstone Knights captured it."   
Dr. Levi read aloud from the parchment.   
"The bedtime stories you heard as children were only a fraction of the truth."   
He opened a book and fluently recited lines of Latin.   

Dr. Levi unlocked a chest, embossed with the Rothschild family's red shield.   
Inside was nothing but scrolls filled with Roman numerals.   
"The most crucial piece—Gerald's Metal Armor—is missing."   

"Why is that important?"   
"The entire imprint of Maria's grandmother's palms is embedded in the armor."   
Dr. Levi moved toward a bookshelf filled with family legends.   
"According to legend, only with her palms could the gemstone energy be activated."   

As they left the basement, Peter turned to Dr. Levi.   
"I suspect the Rothschild family still has it.   
But we don't even know exactly who they are."   
"Then there's no way to contact them?"   

"Of course there is! Ha! Times have changed.   
The descendants of the Gemstone Knights communicate through blockchain networks now.   
There's nothing better for anonymity and transparency."   

Dr. Levi returned to the café upstairs and powered on his laptop.   
The Gemstone Knights' descendants had formed a DAO—one of countless Ethereum-based DAOs.   
All proposals and discussions were encrypted, ensuring the original content was completely obfuscated.   

Dr. Levi drafted an agenda using a smart contract, requesting the return of the armor.   
"Sometimes, I wonder...   
What has become of the descendants of the Gemstone Knights from Maria's grandmother's era?   
Where do they live now? What kind of lives do they lead?"   

      

# 14. Swiss Mercenaries   
      

"Let's reconsider what Max told us last night.   
The Rothschild family stakes gold as collateral and lends out gemstones...   
It's a brilliant idea, but can we really meet them?   
Would they even accept our proposal?"   

Maria's father sipped his water, clearly nursing a hangover from the previous night.   

"Father."   
Maria watched him carefully as she refilled his glass.   

"That means we would have to entrust some of our own gemstones to them too, right?"   

An uneasy silence filled the room.   

"If I hoard all this power, eventually, it will change me. It will change us."   

"And what do we trust?"   

Maria nodded thoughtfully.   

"My hands. Without me, the gemstone's power can't be fully activated, right?   
So we can safely lend them out if we keep the key separate."   

"That might work. But first, we need to establish trust."   
Maria's father set down his soup with a grimace.   

"Who knows? If it's God's will..."   
Maria gave a small smile.   

Outside, Uncle Andrea entered, bringing news from the Swiss mercenaries.   

"Many regions are still undecided about joining the fight,   
but the Habsburg forces are powerful.   
If we had gemstones, many would flock to our side."   

"That's right!" "So would we!" "Count us in!" "Here too!"   

Their eyes gleamed.   

The famed Swiss mercenaries were known across Europe, earning fortunes in single campaigns.   

"With only three cantons actively fighting, they'll need these gemstones.   
We should travel between them, lending gemstones in exchange for gold."   

"That way, more mercenaries will gather and return to Obwalden."   

"Exactly!"   
Maria's father and uncle clapped in agreement.   

Someone had to contact the Rothschild family to negotiate.   
Maria's father muttered, "Who should go?"   

"I'll go."   
It was Max again.   

"You startled me! Where did you come from?"   
He emerged from beneath the table, rubbing his eyes.   

"It's rumored their patriarch has fallen ill, and the eldest son has recently taken over.   
They might just be open to this deal now. The old man was too stubborn, saw no profit in it."   

Everything moved swiftly from there.   

Switzerland was so decentralized that forming an alliance or launching a campaign required broad agreement from all regions.   

Public sentiment and meticulous planning were essential.   

"Can we really stand against the Imperial Army?"   

"They're a unified force. One command, one front."   
The nervous murmurs of inexperienced Obwalden villagers filled the air.   

At the headquarters, Commander Werner met with Maria's father to discuss how to distribute gemstones for war.   

"Schneider."   
At the meeting's conclusion, Werner called for the mercenary captain.   

"Yes, sir!"   

"Handpick your finest troops to escort Maria. She'll travel to the three Swiss cantons to rally more warriors."   

They hoped Maria's gemstone power would inspire more to rise up.   

"Keep her safe, please."   
Maria's father bowed deeply in gratitude.   

"Haha, worry not!"   
Schneider thumped his chest confidently.   

Maria rummaged through her sack and picked out a large gemstone for Schneider.   

"You're huge, so you need a big one too!"   

"Haha, thanks, young lady!"   

Within a week, Maria would set off across Switzerland.   

That midnight, restless, she went to her grandmother's house.   

They whispered about old gemstone legends until dawn.
