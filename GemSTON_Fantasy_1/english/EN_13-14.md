# 13. The Vanished Metal Armor <br>
<br><br><br>

The muffled sounds of trams passing overhead and the murmur of tourists echoed faintly. <br>
The basement of Café Marta. <br>

When Peter stepped into the basement with Dr. Levi, <br>
he was surprised by how bright it was. <br>

Storage cabinets filled with gemstone boxes lined the walls, <br>
illuminating the space like daylight. <br>

"What's that sound of flowing water?" <br>
"Peter, this basement is lower than the Aare River. If we don't keep pumping out the water, it'll flood." <br>
"These days, you can just use an electric pump, but how did they do it back then?" <br>
"Even now, electricity isn't necessary. The gemstones themselves keep the water out." <br>
Dr. Levi pointed to the drainage channel running along the bottom of the basement walls. <br>
"Underneath, gemstones are boiling the water, creating convection currents that push the water out." <br>

The deeper they moved into the basement, the brighter the light became. <br>
Stronger gemstones of various colors were placed in the center. <br>

Ancient parchment documents were scattered around, <br>
along with weapons once wielded by the Gemstone Knights—lances, shields, longbows, crossbows, and suits of armor. <br>
Most impressive was the grand banner, emblazoned with the emblem of the Gemstone Knights, said to have been bestowed by Pope Clement V. <br>

But on the opposite wall, though its colors had faded, <br>
a magnificent red cloak adorned with golden buttons hung unfurled. <br>
"Impressive, isn't it? This belonged to Cesar. It says here that the Gemstone Knights captured it." <br>
Dr. Levi read aloud from the parchment. <br>
"The bedtime stories you heard as children were only a fraction of the truth." <br>
He opened a book and fluently recited lines of Latin. <br>

Dr. Levi unlocked a chest, embossed with the Rothschild family's red shield. <br>
Inside was nothing but scrolls filled with Roman numerals. <br>
"The most crucial piece—Gerald's Metal Armor—is missing." <br>

"Why is that important?" <br>
"The entire imprint of Maria's grandmother's palms is embedded in the armor." <br>
Dr. Levi moved toward a bookshelf filled with family legends. <br>
"According to legend, only with her palms could the gemstone energy be activated." <br>

As they left the basement, Peter turned to Dr. Levi. <br>
"I suspect the Rothschild family still has it. <br>
But we don't even know exactly who they are." <br>
"Then there's no way to contact them?" <br>

"Of course there is! Ha! Times have changed. <br>
The descendants of the Gemstone Knights communicate through blockchain networks now. <br>
There's nothing better for anonymity and transparency." <br>

Dr. Levi returned to the café upstairs and powered on his laptop. <br>
The Gemstone Knights' descendants had formed a DAO—one of countless Ethereum-based DAOs. <br>
All proposals and discussions were encrypted, ensuring the original content was completely obfuscated. <br>

Dr. Levi drafted an agenda using a smart contract, requesting the return of the armor. <br>
"Sometimes, I wonder... <br>
What has become of the descendants of the Gemstone Knights from Maria's grandmother's era? <br>
Where do they live now? What kind of lives do they lead?" <br>

<br><br><br>

# 14. Swiss Mercenaries <br>
<br><br><br>

"Let's reconsider what Max told us last night. <br>
The Rothschild family stakes gold as collateral and lends out gemstones... <br>
It's a brilliant idea, but can we really meet them? <br>
Would they even accept our proposal?" <br>

Maria's father sipped his water, clearly nursing a hangover from the previous night. <br>

"Father." <br>
Maria watched him carefully as she refilled his glass. <br>

"That means we would have to entrust some of our own gemstones to them too, right?" <br>

An uneasy silence filled the room. <br>

"If I hoard all this power, eventually, it will change me. It will change us." <br>

"And what do we trust?" <br>

Maria nodded thoughtfully. <br>

"My hands. Without me, the gemstone's power can't be fully activated, right? <br>
So we can safely lend them out if we keep the key separate." <br>

"That might work. But first, we need to establish trust." <br>
Maria's father set down his soup with a grimace. <br>

"Who knows? If it's God's will..." <br>
Maria gave a small smile. <br>

Outside, Uncle Andrea entered, bringing news from the Swiss mercenaries. <br>

"Many regions are still undecided about joining the fight, <br>
but the Habsburg forces are powerful. <br>
If we had gemstones, many would flock to our side." <br>

"That's right!" "So would we!" "Count us in!" "Here too!" <br>

Their eyes gleamed. <br>

The famed Swiss mercenaries were known across Europe, earning fortunes in single campaigns. <br>

"With only three cantons actively fighting, they'll need these gemstones. <br>
We should travel between them, lending gemstones in exchange for gold." <br>

"That way, more mercenaries will gather and return to Obwalden." <br>

"Exactly!" <br>
Maria's father and uncle clapped in agreement. <br>

Someone had to contact the Rothschild family to negotiate. <br>
Maria's father muttered, "Who should go?" <br>

"I'll go." <br>
It was Max again. <br>

"You startled me! Where did you come from?" <br>
He emerged from beneath the table, rubbing his eyes. <br>

"It's rumored their patriarch has fallen ill, and the eldest son has recently taken over. <br>
They might just be open to this deal now. The old man was too stubborn, saw no profit in it." <br>

Everything moved swiftly from there. <br>

Switzerland was so decentralized that forming an alliance or launching a campaign required broad agreement from all regions. <br>

Public sentiment and meticulous planning were essential. <br>

"Can we really stand against the Imperial Army?" <br>

"They're a unified force. One command, one front." <br>
The nervous murmurs of inexperienced Obwalden villagers filled the air. <br>

At the headquarters, Commander Werner met with Maria's father to discuss how to distribute gemstones for war. <br>

"Schneider." <br>
At the meeting's conclusion, Werner called for the mercenary captain. <br>

"Yes, sir!" <br>

"Handpick your finest troops to escort Maria. She'll travel to the three Swiss cantons to rally more warriors." <br>

They hoped Maria's gemstone power would inspire more to rise up. <br>

"Keep her safe, please." <br>
Maria's father bowed deeply in gratitude. <br>

"Haha, worry not!" <br>
Schneider thumped his chest confidently. <br>

Maria rummaged through her sack and picked out a large gemstone for Schneider. <br>

"You're huge, so you need a big one too!" <br>

"Haha, thanks, young lady!" <br>

Within a week, Maria would set off across Switzerland. <br>

That midnight, restless, she went to her grandmother's house. <br>

They whispered about old gemstone legends until dawn. <br>
