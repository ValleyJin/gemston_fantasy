# 3. The Everlasting Candle of Bern

November 2, 1313, near dawn.    
On the road heading to Bern, Switzerland.    

The chill of Lake Murten (Murtensee) swept across the high plains,    
while a caravan of carriages pushed through a raging snowstorm.    

"Maria's burning up with a fever."    
Maria's mother gently tried cooling her daughter's forehead.    
Perhaps puberty was setting in; Maria had shot up in height these past few months,    
yet her parents still doted on her like a child.    

Her father said nothing, not even turning his head.    
"Hang in there a bit. We'll reach Bern in about a day."    

The first carriage held Maria's immediate family, followed by her cousins' wagons,    
and at the end came several wagons stacked high with cargo sacks, rattling noisily.    

"What's the point of lugging around all those rocks…?"    
"Shh, dear... Mother-in-law might hear you."    
"That woman's wishes can't be denied... Good grief."    
"This family has been miners for generations. You know how it is."    
Maria's grandmother dozed off in the seat, lulled by the carriage's rocking, the perfect sedative.    

Awooo...    

"Wolves, huh? In winter, they'd be starving. Hey, Andrea! They'll target the last wagon."    
"I'll go check."    

A hulking alpha wolf led a pack loping forward.    
The last carriage, loaded with cargo, was pulled by two strong, well-fed horses.    
Andrea caught the glint in the wolves' eyes under the torchlight; they looked ravenous indeed.    

"Damn beasts."    
He waved his torch to scare them off,    
then hurled it at the lead wolf.    

He lashed his horse to the wagon, climbed atop the cargo bed,    
and frantically tore open sacks of rocks, flinging them into the darkness.    
Before long, a stone struck one unlucky wolf square in the forehead, echoing a shrill yelp across the snow.    

But the tang of blood only enraged the others, at least fifty strong, launching a full-on assault.    

"Andrea!!! Once we reach the edge of the lake, I'll swerve hard. Hold on!"    
Maria's father shouted from the lead.    
But Andrea was busy fending off a wolf clawing onto the cargo bed.    
He pitched a whole sack of rocks at it, lost his balance, and tumbled backward.    

Thud.    
He crashed onto a sack, half-knocking himself out.    
Maria's father had executed his plan, yanking the carriage around sharply right at the shore of Lake Murten.    

"Three... two... one..."    
At that exact moment,    
the cargo-laden wagon unleashed a tremendous burst of light.    
It illuminated the frozen lake and glacier-lined valley like midday.    
The wolf pack, charging at full speed, was suddenly blinded, unable to change course—    
they plummeted into the lake en masse.

Maria's father sensed a flash behind him. Even squinting, it was too brilliant to face.    

"What on earth...?"    
He felt as though his eyes would pop out from the glare.    

Just then,    
"Honey!!! Look at Maria!"    
Maria's mother cried out.    
Both her hands and Maria's skirt were suddenly soaked in blood.    

The faint dawn rose over the horizon.

Ten days passed after Maria's family arrived at a remote mountain village near Bern.    

Because it lay high in the mountains, night fell quickly.    
Mere moments before, the slope had been touched by sunlight,    
but now the footsteps of salt-mine workers heading home echoed in the twilight.    

Inside a local tavern thick with the aroma of meat stew,    
Maria's father looked at a candle.    
The flickering light brought out the deep lines in his face.    
Uncle Andrea's head was bandaged from the injuries he sustained on the wagon.    

"We barely made it here, and they're not even buying candles. What a rotten place..."    
He downed half his beer.    

"You can't afford fancy candles anyway, not after losing all your gold in Rome,"    
his wife remarked as she sipped soup.    

"They call themselves a holy empire, but in Rome they just do whatever vile deeds they please."    
He tore some bread, dipping it in the soup before setting it aside.    
"Our family lost so many toiling in the mines,    
only to be exiled with nothing but worthless lumps of stone for compensation..."    

"Where there's misfortune, there's also good. Our Maria's grown into a fine young lady—something to celebrate."    
"She started her first monthly cycle amidst all that chaos... Talk about timing."    
"Honestly, I nearly fainted. I thought she was injured badly."    
"Dear, about that flash that blinded the wolves—what in God's name was that?"    
"I'm clueless. You couldn't open your eyes either, right? It was just blazing all around us."    

But oh well,    
it drove off the wolves,    
and after three months on the road, they were finally in Bern. Now they had to figure out how to survive.    
He glanced around the table, where the family—Maria, her brother Hans, and some cousins—were gathered, about a dozen mouths to feed.    

"With so many to feed, I'd better find mining work. Otherwise..."    
He trailed off, finishing the last of his beer.    
"You'll manage. Take heart, dear."    
But her reassurance seemed weaker than half a mug of beer.    

"Brother, be strong. People here treated us exiled Jews better than anywhere else. We should be grateful."    
Uncle Andrea squeezed his brother's hand.    

"If we don't land a mining job soon, I'll head out as a mercenary with Andrea, so keep that in mind."    
Their father clasped Andrea's hand back. They exchanged a long, calm gaze.    

"How many mercenaries survive, anyway? Don't say that in front of the kids."    
"Look around—everyone here does that. Guess we'll have to do the same."    
A hush fell over the entire family.    

Maria, fiddling with a few pebbles, noticed her father's eyes.    
She and Hans were so young still, tears welling in their eyes as they clutched the small stones.    
Maria hugged Hans to keep him from crying, then bowed her head, squeezing the pebbles tightly.    

"At least I won't be a useless father."    
At his weary remark, tears fell from Maria's cheeks onto the pebbles in her grasp.    

"Dad!"    
Suddenly Maria stood, brandishing the sack of stones, smiling brightly.    
She was cheerful by nature, always trying to reassure him with her confident gaze.    

"I'll sell these! I'll wander the village and trade them for candles!"

Crash!    
The tavern rattled.    
A huge man nearly got stuck in the doorway, the wood creaking under his bulk.    

"Oh, Maximilian! Did you haul in anything good today? Bring the big keg of beer!"    

A brawny figure known as Max surveyed the tavern, deliberately sitting next to Maria's father,    
placing a giant paw on the table that groaned under the weight.    

"Earlier, I saw you whining for candles outside the mine, you Jewish fellow."    
Max smirked at the older man's profile.    

"No candles come into this town without my say-so, you hear?    
I'm the only licensed chandler under Grand Duke Cheringen. You're just some tax-dodging nobody..."    

He never finished the sentence. Their mother cried out,    
because Maria's father wordlessly stood and mashed each burning candle on the tables with his mug, snuffing them out.    

"You crazy old—this is my tavern.    
You got money to pay for those candles?"    
Max drew a blade from its sheath, glowering fiercely.    
He flipped the table with a violent shove.    

![alt text](/GemSTON_Fantasy_1/images/father_max_duel.png)

"If you can best me in a duel, I won't charge you for the damage."    

Max grabbed a sword from the wall and tossed it to Maria's father.    
Their mother had collapsed in fright, and Maria and Hans tried to rush over, only for Uncle Andrea to hold them back.    
Tears brimmed in Maria's large eyes.    

With one hand, Max easily flung Maria's father into a corner, sending his sword flying upward.    

At that instant, a brilliant light suddenly flashed from behind, striking Max's blade in reflection, and momentarily blinding him.    
He jerked around, nearly twisting his neck.

People watched in confusion, for the candles had all been extinguished, yet the tavern was glowing as bright as day.    

Amid hushed murmurs, they saw the source of the dazzling glare.    

It was Maria.    
She had been shoved into an alcove earlier by Uncle Andrea to keep her out of harm's way.    

But that wasn't all.    
The pebbles on the table glowed even more intensely than the candles had before.    

"Mister, can you... use these instead of candles?"    
said Maria, tears swelling in her wide eyes.    
She looked up at Max with a bright grin.

"What in the world did you do?"    

Their mother, uncle, and cousins ran out of the tavern, utterly startled.    
Maria, on the verge of tears, could barely speak until her mother arrived to hold her tight.    

Riding piggyback on her mother, Maria left for home in haste.    
After tucking Maria in to sleep, her mother gently awakened her.    

"Maria."    

"...Mom, sorry. It's because of those stones, right?"    
"The stones aren't the real issue."    

Still thirsty, her mother grabbed a cup of water.    
She fiddled with the kettle, then paused, opening the window to gaze at the moon for a while before speaking:    

"Perhaps you're the real problem."    
The moonlight cast a strange smile on her mother's face, the curtains swaying in the breeze.    

"It's late, but go see Grandma now."    

Maria's grandmother lived alone in a tiny cottage on the nearby hill.    
Maria's mother, anticipating her daughter's next words, preempted them with:    

"You can stay there overnight if you want."    

So Maria slipped out the back door, making sure not to wake the rest of the family.    
She threw on a cloak, lit a torch, and headed for the stable.    

But she stopped after only a few steps.    

Next to the stable stood their wagon, filled with sacks of small pebbles that shone so brightly    
they illuminated the entire road.
