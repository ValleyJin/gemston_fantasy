# 6. The Beginning of a Feud   

Spring had arrived in Bern.  

Over the past few months, Max had become a complete drunkard. He cursed Maria as a witch and reported to Grand Duke Zähringen that his candle business had suffered because of her.  

"The Grand Duke has sent a letter to the Avignon. A special envoy should arrive soon—there's no way they'll sit idly by when a witch has appeared."  

Drunk, Max staggered through the town square. Behind the fountain, a neatly dressed young man approached. It was Caesar, who had arrived in Bern two months after leaving the Avignon.  

However, in Max’s eyes, he was nothing more than a brat just asking for trouble.  

"Hey! You don’t look like you're from around here!"  
He threw out a remark and, as the young man passed by, grabbed his left shoulder tightly.  

"Aaargh!"  
Caesar clutched his shoulder, now burned from Max’s grip, and collapsed to the ground.  
"Your shoulder... what the... ugh..."  

"Do you go around showing off your strength to random passersby, you hairy brute?"  
Caesar, looking down at Max sprawled on the ground, fired back with a sharp retort.  

Max quickly scrambled to his feet, drawing a dagger from his belt and driving it into Caesar’s shoulder. However, the blade snapped in two, and only unknown metal fragments fell from Caesar’s shoulder.  

"What the hell is this guy?!"  
Bewildered, Max was suddenly lifted into the air with just one hand—Caesar’s left hand, shrouded in mystery.  

"Is this how you welcome a man who has come to hunt a witch?"  
"A-Ah... so you're here to meet Grand Duke Zähringen?"  

Dangling in midair by his collar, barely able to breathe, Max suddenly became exceedingly polite.  

. . .  

"He’s here..."  
Maria’s mother muttered to herself as she gazed at Bern’s sunset.  

The elderly woman sipping tea beside her nodded.  
"It seems the time has come. I'll go fetch Maria."  

How much should she tell Maria?  
Her mother was deeply lost in thought.  

When she had reached adolescence, she too had experienced vivid visions through the gemstone. She had even seen the form of the demon who had bestowed its power.  

It had been an utterly terrifying experience. Convinced that she could never fully control the gemstone, she had distanced herself from it, choosing to forget about its existence.  

But the visions had only grown clearer over time. Eventually, they transformed into incomprehensible sequences of numbers. She had spent her entire life writing them down.  

Just a few days ago, she had finally completed the sequence, and since then, no new numbers had appeared in her visions.  

"Maria,"  
Her voice was warm as she called her daughter’s name and handed her a scroll.  

"I don’t know what these numbers mean, but keep them safe."  
Maria’s large eyes sparkled as she read the numbers.  

. . .  

**BANG! BANG! BANG!**  

The sound of pounding on the door was followed by Max’s shouting. He had come with Caesar to find Maria’s house.  

Sensing fate at work, Maria’s mother took the gemstone necklace from her daughter’s neck and placed it around her own.  

"Mother, I will pray for you."  
Maria held the gemstone necklace tightly in her hands, her small fingers pressing against the smooth surface. Then, she wrapped herself in her mother's embrace and began to pray.  

After wiping away her tears, Maria’s mother set her lips in a firm line. Pushing Maria aside, she rose confidently and stepped outside to face Caesar and his men.  

"Is this what you came for?"  
She pointed to the gemstone necklace hanging from her neck.  

"Ha! We've got more than enough of those already."  
Caesar shoved his hand into his pocket and pulled out several gemstones, shaking them lightly.  

As his smile faded and he gave a slight nod, the soldiers stormed into the house and dragged Maria out.  

"What do you intend to do to the child?! I won’t stand for this!"  
Her fury ignited the gemstone, making it glow a deep red.  

"Oh? So it reacts. Let’s see how it works, shall we?"  
Caesar raised his hand, and the soldiers pressed their blades against Maria’s throat.  

At that very moment—  

A powerful flash of light burst from the gemstone necklace and shot toward Caesar.  

Startled, Caesar reflexively deflected it with his left arm. But his arm shattered into pieces, scattering metallic fragments everywhere. Among them were gemstones, some cracked and glowing faintly.  

The streak of light veered off, splitting the lake at the foot of the hill in two before soaring into the village square. There, it shattered both the fountain and the statue of Grand Duke Zähringen into rubble.  

**THUD!**  

With a dull sound, Maria’s mother collapsed.  
A soldier had struck her on the head with a club from behind.  

"So the witch capable of fully controlling the gemstone's power was here all along."  
Caesar sneered as he ordered his men to load Maria’s mother onto a carriage bound for the Avignon.  

Maria’s father, who had been working in the mines, only returned home hours later.  
His vacant eyes stared into nothingness, filled with an unbearable emptiness.
