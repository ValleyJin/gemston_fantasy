**November 18, 2031 – CERN Laboratory, Switzerland**  

Deep beneath the Franco-Swiss border, the underground research facility of CERN hummed with energy.  

Inside the control room, a group of scientists gathered around a set of monitors.  

"Doctor, are you sure about this?"  
"The energy levels have exceeded the safety threshold."  
"If anything goes wrong—"  

Dr. Levy adjusted his glasses and silenced his colleague with a glance.  
"Proceed with the experiment."  

With a final keystroke, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) activated.  

A deep vibration resonated through the underground tunnel as subatomic particles accelerated to near-light speed.  

The detectors registered an unusual energy signature.  

"Unbelievable… We're seeing an anomaly that doesn't match any known physical models."  

Suddenly, an alarm rang out.  

The energy readings **spiked beyond expected limits.**  

Then— **total darkness.**  

The entire underground facility lost power.  

Emergency red lights flickered on, casting eerie shadows on the walls.  

"What happened?! Restart the system—now!"  

Technicians scrambled to regain control, frantically inputting commands.  

Then, something **impossible** occurred.  

A floating **ring of light** formed in the accelerator chamber.  

It pulsed with an unfamiliar rhythm, as if responding to something unseen.  

One of the researchers whispered, "Is it… reacting to us?"  

Dr. Levy's gaze remained fixed on the phenomenon.  
"This is no ordinary reaction."  

Within the luminous ring, **symbols that should not exist in this era** appeared.  

A sequence of **prime numbers** glowed within the structure.  

Then, without warning, the ring **collapsed inward**—vanishing into a single point.  

Silence followed.  

A scientist checked the atomic clock.  
Only a second had passed.  

But outside, the **stars had shifted position.**  

CERN's midnight experiment had altered something far beyond their understanding.

# 25. The Templar Order <br>
<br><br><br>
**November 20, 1315**  <br>  
<br>  
After his crushing defeat at the Battle of Morgarten,  
Leopold I spent five grueling days avoiding pursuit before finally arriving at Habsburg Castle.   
Under normal circumstances, the journey from Morgarten to this small fortress,  
nestled in the Aargau region closer than Bern, would have taken merely a day.  

Perched atop a modest hill, the castle, despite its size, boasted a commanding vantage point,  
ideal for surveying the surrounding lands.  
From afar, César's steward, ever watchful, noticed the approaching retinue and rode out to greet them.  

There was no trace of surprise on the steward's face.  
As though already informed of the inevitable outcome, he extended a scroll.  
"Lord César's messenger arrived not long ago. He brought this."  

Still clutching his bleeding shoulder,  
Leopold dismounted in haste and unrolled the parchment with urgent hands.  
"Damn it… César knew I would lose?"  

The message was brief.  

"To His Highness, Leopold I,  
If you are reading this letter, it means I am dead.  
And, I suspect, you have suffered a defeat as well.  

Mark my words.  
The key to unlocking the power of the GemSTON lies in both palms of Maria.  
You must claim her hands.  

First,  
Leverage her mother, who remains imprisoned in the dungeon, as bait.  

By now, Maria is likely already on her way to rescue her mother.  
Summon the Knights Templar at once and prepare for her arrival.  

Offer them half of the GemSTONs I have amassed,  
and they will accept.  
Their prowess will prove invaluable."   

Leopold closed his eyes, pondering deeply.  
César's steward, who had been waiting nearby, finally spoke,  
"You must be wondering—why the Knights Templar, of all people?"  
Leopold remained silent.  

"Your Highness, I imagine you are considering riding to the Hofburg Palace in Austria,  
to seek aid from the imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire?"  
Leopold cleared his throat awkwardly and gazed into the distance.  

"If you do that," the steward continued,  
"you would merely be offering the power of the GemSTON to the Habsburg dynasty on a silver platter."  
Leopold's eyes gleamed with sudden realization.  
"Yes… Yes! If I wield the power, the dynasty's reins will fall into my hands!"  

At his command, a courier immediately departed.  
And within two days,  
the palace grounds were overrun with the horses of the arriving Knights Templar.  

"The call of the future ruler of the Holy Roman Empire cannot be ignored! Ha-ha-ha!"  
Johan, the leader of the seven Templar knights,  
bowed with impeccable courtesy before Leopold,  
his elite warriors standing behind him in silent acknowledgment.  

Leopold, eager to seal their loyalty,  
lavished them with the finest feasts and the richest wines.    
"My scouts have already set up ambushes along the approach," he declared.  
"We will capture Maria and her entourage before they even reach the castle."  

The speed and efficiency of the Templars impressed him.  
"Surely, you have heard whispers of the GemSTON's power," he prodded.  

The knights, enjoying their meal, merely shrugged.  
"Maria, is it? They say only she can harness its power."  
"A few ragged peasants follow her, but they are mere country bumpkins who have never wielded a blade."  
"Then what's the problem? Let's finish this quickly! Ha-ha-ha!"

Leopold's expression darkened.    
He suddenly stood,  
ripping off his upper garments and exposing his wounded shoulder before the knights.  

The scar was still fresh,  
the torn flesh glistening with blood.  

"You must have heard tales of my swordsmanship," he said,   
unsheathing his blade and making a swift arc through the air.  

A single apple atop the table split cleanly into four pieces.  
"And yet,  
even I ended up like this."   
Silence gripped the hall.  
All eyes remained fixed on Leopold as he continued in a measured tone.  

"It was the GemSTON."  
With a resounding *thud*,  
he drove his sword into the table.  

A suffocating silence fell over the hall.
