“My dear Peter,    
I, your old Grandpa, arrived in Bern earlier this month,    
and took some time to look around.    

Abigail's group left Australia, too,    
so let's meet at Cafe Marta tomorrow evening as planned.    

Bring the GemSTON sample.    
It's ours anyway, so borrowing it for a bit shouldn't be an issue, right?”    

.    
.    
.    

Peter (Peter Levi) rechecked that message and stepped into Cafe Marta.    

"Do you have a reservation name?"    
"Andrew Levi. A tall older gentleman with a white beard."    
"Ah, over by the basement storeroom entrance. They're all here already."    

"Grandpa!"    
Peter dashed over and gave his grandfather a hug.    

Dr. Andrew Levi—now well into his senior years—looked just as delighted to see all his grandchildren.    
It had been ages since they all gathered like this.    

The various grandchildren, scattered around the world, were also excited to reunite.    
They spent a good while hugging, greeting, and making a ruckus.    

All of a sudden, Dr. Levi said,    
"You brought it, right? Put it on the table."    
"What if people see, Grandpa? You're too casual about this…"    

"Eh, they'll think it's just a souvenir. This is Bern, a big tourist city, with all these pubs."    
"Come on, Grandpa. Cafe Marta isn't a pub. You're the one who insisted on ordering beer, haha."    
Abigail, sharp-eyed, massaged her grandfather's shoulders.    

Peter, having just arrived, plopped into a chair and fished around in his bag. He pulled out a jewel and set it on the table.    
He thought Grandpa was being uncharacteristically careless today.    

Instantly, the table lit up with an iridescent glow.    

"Oooh…"

"I borrowed this sample without official permission. If they find out, I could get booted from CERN,"    
Peter grumbled.    
"Hey, how did our ancestors even wear such a massive stone?"    
Abigail lightly touched the gem, marveling at its radiance.    

"Yeah, if they notice, I'm out at CERN. It was tough enough getting that job,"    
Peter said, still dissatisfied.    
Dr. Levi gave him a quick nod of reassurance.    
"Sorry about that. Since we don't have a high-powered synchrotron on our end, I needed your help for analysis."    
Peter nodded in return.    
"And you remember, everything is…"    
Dr. Levi gave a playful wink.    
"Off the record."    

"Good grief. Our family used to be miners, but now we've produced a fancy scientist, huh?"    
Some other grandchildren snickered.    
"You watch yourself, man! You can't get fired. Haha."    
Offering Dr. Levi a mug of beer, Christian chimed in,    
"We used to dig in the dirt. He just digs into books."    
They all displayed the jewels they wore as necklaces, earrings, or bracelets.    
"But we're richer, haha. Building a whole jewelry business is probably tougher than your physics, Peter."    

Bern's old quarter was calm this night,    
but the small cafe bustled with unusual liveliness.    
Maybe because the descendants of Maria's family, who left here long ago, had all come to visit.    

Their beers arrived at the table.    
Abigail licked her lips, pulling her long hair back.    
She glanced up at the wall, noticing some paintings hanging there.    
Curious, she stood and examined them.    

One painting showed a giant wielding a huge halberd.    
A large gemstone glowed on his chest armor.    

She looked back and forth between the shining gem on the table    
and the painted gem in the artwork.    
They were obviously of the same type.    

Another painting, from the medieval era, depicted a young girl.    
"Is that Grandma Maria from the old legend?"    
Abigail asked Dr. Levi.    
"Yes, it is."    
"It looks ancient."    
"Nearly a thousand years old. Passed down in the Levi family for centuries."    

Dr. Levi rose and joined her, studying the painting's symmetry.    

"What's that circular mark like a coin hole in her palms?"    
Peter asked, stepping closer.    

Dr. Levi didn't answer directly. Instead, he changed the subject.    
"Yesterday, I bought this cafe from its old owners. First thing I did was hang these paintings."    
"Huh?"    
All the grandchildren paused—some cutting into sausage, some sipping beer—staring at him.    
"You owned the building, but you actually bought out the cafe business? Why? What are you planning?"    
Abigail quickly interjected, before he could dodge the question.    

"I only told you I'd share a bit of an old family story. This is merely the beginning. I've got more to do here."    
Grinning, Dr. Levi casually stole a piece of Peter's neatly cut white sausage onto his own plate.    
"I'll crash at your place tonight, though," he teased.    
The grandchildren kept giggling.    

"Grandpa, you explained over the phone, but we still can't believe it,"    
Peter said abruptly.    
"All those bedtime legends we heard as kids… how could any of it be real? We're not little kids anymore."    

Abigail, apparently amused, flicked her gaze between Peter and Dr. Levi.    
Then she gave a half laugh, resting her chin in one hand.    
But the other grandchildren were now staring keenly, as if waiting for a revelation.    

"Wow. Everyone is so serious,"    
Abigail mused, scanning the room. The oldest grandson, Christian, finally spoke up.    
"I was always curious. Our jewelry business thrived, and these old legends sometimes felt too real."    

"It's real, all right,"    
Dr. Levi said, taking a swig of foamy beer.    

"It all began here in Bern, with this gem that only responded to the women in our family."    
He stroked the gleaming stone on the table.    
The jewel's self-luminous glow flickered gently, illuminating the faint smile on the older man's face.    

Then he looked once more at the ancient painting on the wall, speaking quietly.    
To his grandchildren, who had heard this legend a hundred times before,    
the crisp Bern night air gave them the sense anything might be possible.
