# 15. Cesar's Scheme  
      

The Habsburg Palace in Aargau, Switzerland.  
Although the family had risen to the throne of great European powers, including Austria,  
Leopold remained bound to this small country, burdened by the recent uprisings in several cantons.    

"A fool who cannot even unify Switzerland,"  
he muttered to himself as he entered the palace.    

As he arrived, his aides, who had been waiting, gathered to greet him.  
"Lord Cesar, welcome back."    

"I have finally identified the witch who can unlock the power of the Gemstone.  
Keep a close watch on her. She will be useful as bait."    

Inside the carriage, Maria's mother was bound and blindfolded,  
before being dragged away to the underground prison.    

"But, Your Lordship, His Majesty already seems to be aware  
that you stopped by the Papal Court before coming here."    

Feigning indifference, Cesar flinched slightly.    

He was about to head into the emperor's office but changed course,  
walking instead toward his quarters in the annex.    

From afar, Tori came running.  
"Oh, my sweet little pup."    

Cesar stroked Tori's thick, raccoon-like tail.    

"You're the only one who calls Tori a dog, my lord. Ha ha."  
"Well, he acts just like one. Ha ha ha."    

After giving Tori a thorough rub and pulling him close to his chest,  
Cesar walked through the corridor and entered his room.    

Tori glanced around the room before speaking.  
"Leopold... his movements... are suspicious..."    

Tori's voice stuttered.  
Something was wrong.    

Cesar opened the back panel and replaced the Gemstone.  
The old, depleted Gemstone was tossed out the window.    

"Cesar, Cesar!"  
"Now that I've replaced you with a fresh one, your voice is booming again. Ha ha ha."    

Cesar meticulously checked Tori's body,  
proudly affirming his place as the finest automata maker in Europe.    

A projection lit up the wall,  
displaying the recordings that Tori had gathered while roaming the palace.    

As Cesar listened to the briefing, his expression darkened.  
"That cunning Leopold..."    

Gripping his goblet, Cesar cursed under his breath.  
"He's been receiving reports in real time. There was a spy following me in Avignon!"    

"Then he must suspect that I'm betraying him..."    

Tori drew a dagger from his pouch.  
"Whoa, whoa, Tori. Not now, ha ha ha."    

For a while, Cesar stared into the crackling fire,  
occasionally sipping his wine.    

For a man who could never sleep in peace,  
perhaps this was the closest thing to rest.    

"For now, I'll pretend nothing has happened."    

Fixing his attire, he stepped out into the hallway, heading toward Leopold's office.    

At that moment, the royal family members of the House of Habsburg  
were passing through the corridors for the ongoing banquet,  
greeting Cesar as they walked by.    

Cesar's distinguished looks and refined manners had already made him  
a favorite among the young women and widows of the family.    

"I had a lovely time playing with Tori.  
Even though he's an automaton, he's incredible.  
He understands every word as if there's a real person inside!"    

Princess Josephine was an audacious liar.    

Cesar had just seen the footage in Tori's report—  
how she had kicked Tori and poured hot tea over him.    

"Oh, well. I do enjoy making things.  
That's why I keep designing weapons for the unification of the Eastern Roman Empire."    

Cesar pulled a telescope from his pocket and handed it to Josephine.    

"Oh wow! This is truly amazing.  
I can see mountains on the moon! I've never seen it this clearly before!"    

Exchanging a few pleasantries,  
Cesar sent Josephine on her way and resumed his walk toward Leopold's office.    

Just as he was about to enter, he met Leopold in the corridor.    

"Oh! When did you return?"    

Leopold dismissed Cesar's formal greeting with a wave of his hand,  
leading him into a private chamber.    

"All the royal family members are gathered here,  
but honestly, the royal treasury is tight,  
and they want to avoid an all-out war if possible."    

After listening to the situation, Cesar proposed a strategy—  
to prevent any cantons outside the three main rebel states from joining the war.    

His solution was to offer noble titles to the leaders of various Swiss regions  
and cut their taxes and tributes in half.    

"Would this actually work?"  
"Watch and see.  
These people aren't looking for a war.  
They're just throwing a tantrum, demanding better treatment."    

And indeed, Cesar was right.    

As imperial envoys were dispatched to every Swiss canton with the emperor's decree,  
all except the three main rebel states declared their non-participation in the war.    

.    
.    
.    

Bern, too, received the emperor's decree.  
And now, the same decree had arrived in Obwalden.    

The fervor of the independence war cooled in an instant.    

"The other cantons have already declared their withdrawal,"    

Commander Werner watched as the excitement among his men began to wane.    

Even in Obwalden, soldiers started murmuring  
that it might be wiser to accept the emperor's offer.    

"With just three cantons, we don't stand a chance..."    

General Werner confided his concerns to Maria and her father.    

That wasn't all.    

Even within Obwalden, more soldiers were beginning to voice their doubts.  
Some suggested they should accept the empire's offer.    

That night, Werner visited Mercenary Captain Schneider.    

"The pilgrimage begins tomorrow, doesn't it?"    

Sensing something was wrong,  
Schneider simply nodded.    

"Leave immediately."    

"The decree states that our taxes will be completely abolished...  
if we hand over Maria."    

If they were to escape unnoticed,  
they had to move under the cover of night.    

They couldn't bring too many mercenaries along.    

With only a few carriages, drivers, and a small unit of guards,  
they slipped away from Obwalden.    

Inside the carriage, Maria clutched the Gemstone tightly,  
whispering a silent prayer.
