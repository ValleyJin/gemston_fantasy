# 32. Forging   
      

Gerald followed the Pope into the **underground chambers** of the Papal Palace.  

What he saw **left him speechless.**  

In most **cathedrals** and **papal palaces,** the underground chambers  
were used for **archives** or **the tombs of saints.**  

However, since the Pope had been **exiled to Avignon,**  
this temporary residence lacked such structures.  

Instead, the underground corridors consisted of **simple storage rooms,**  
likely once used as **wine cellars.**  

Though the Pope had been **forcibly brought to France**  
after losing the power struggle with **Philip IV,**  
Gerald couldn't help but feel sympathy for his **fallen authority.**  

As they entered the **largest chamber,**  

Gerald's **GemSTONE necklace suddenly began to glow.**  

"A sign that **many GemSTONEs are nearby.**"  

The Pope smiled, pulling out a **key.**  

He inserted it into a **hidden alcove** in the wall.  

With a **deep rumble,** the wall **rotated,**  
revealing a **hidden staircase leading downward.**  

"From here, this is **my own excavation.**"  

As they descended, the **walls shone brightly—**  

the glow **was not from torches**  
but from **countless GemSTONEs.**  

Each **small chamber** along the underground path  
was **filled with them.**  

"This building was once a **Dominican monastery.**"  

Gerald was **stunned.**  

"A place that should be **dark and damp**  
is now **illuminated by the GemSTONEs themselves.**"  

The Pope nodded.  

"Cesar gathered them.  
He believed they would **restore the Papacy's former glory.**"  

The **sheer scale** was **overwhelming.**  

It was **tens, if not hundreds of times larger**  
than the **GemSTONE reserves hidden in Bern.**  

"While storing these,  
I discovered **something unexpected.**"  

The Pope picked up **several GemSTONEs**  
of **unusual colors.**  

Purple, green, white,  
and even **red ones like those Cesar carried.**  

"You've never seen **these colors** before, have you?"  

The **GemSTONEs** the Pope handed to Gerald  
had **swirling patterns of multiple colors**—  
purple, green, white, and red.  

"When **two or more GemSTONEs**  
are stored together **for long periods,**  
they eventually **merge.**  

Their **power increases tremendously.**  

Just like metal is **forged through fire,**  
these stones undergo their own **forging process.**"  

The Pope led Gerald to a **special chamber**  
containing only **forged GemSTONEs.**  

Some shimmered with **iridescent, rainbow-like hues.**  

The Pope picked up one and handed it to Gerald.  

"The rarer they are,  
the **stronger their power.**  

That was what **Cesar truly desired.**"  

"But why **didn't Cesar** use them?"  

"He was **only capable of wielding red GemSTONEs.**  

Anything beyond that…  
he could not control."  

The Pope caressed the **forged GemSTONE** in his hand,  
his expression distant.  

"Because of that **damned Philip IV,**  
I was forced to **dissolve the Templar Order.**  

I still **supported them in secret,**  
but in the end,  
they **forgot their purpose** and became obsessed with **money.**"  

"They **lost their way,**  
while Cesar **promised you power.**"  

"At first… yes."  

The Pope fell silent,  
then opened a **cabinet** and took out a **bottle of wine.**  

"This bottle…  
I was saving it for the day Cesar and I **united the Empire.**"  

He **uncorked it** and took a long sip.  

"But now,  
I wonder why I ever **desired more power.**"  

"With power, you can **solve problems.**"  

"No.  
**Power creates** the problems."  

"It was **Philip IV**  
who put me on the **Papal throne.**  

And yet, it was **Philip IV**  
who exiled me **here in Avignon.**"  

Gerald **watched the Pope carefully.**  

A man who **once sought power**  
was now **suffering under its weight.**  

"Here in exile,  
I tried **rebuilding my influence.**  

I backed the **Templars**  
but feared they would betray me.  

So I put my faith in **Cesar,**  
a man whose origins were **unknown.**"  

As they climbed the stairs back to the surface,  
the Pope turned to Gerald.  

"But in the end…  

**What was the point of it all?**"  

The **fresh air** of the **Papal Gardens**  
was a stark contrast to the **stale underground chambers.**  

The scent of **grass and flowers**  
cleared their senses.  

"I was moved by the Swiss Confederates' **fight for independence.**  

Why did the Empire even need to **suppress them?**  

For what?  

If people **live in peace,**  
why do they need an **Empire or a Pope?**"  

Gerald was **taken aback.**  

For the Pope,  
one of the most powerful men in Europe,  
to admire **small nations declaring independence** was…  
unexpected.  

A sense of **respect**  
for the aging Pope **grew within Gerald.**  

"Can you and your people **hold onto that mindset?**"  

"…Excuse me?"  

"If **power corrupts,**  
won't the GemSTONEs turn **you** into monsters?"  

Gerald **pondered** before answering.  

"We plan to **distribute the GemSTONEs** among the people  
and **only borrow them when needed.**  

We will continue our **staking system.**"  

The Pope **nodded.**  

"Good.  
Hold onto that belief."  

"What if…  
you gave us **the Avignon's GemSTONEs?**"  

"But…"  

"What's wrong?"  

"The **only person** who can unlock their full power is **Maria.**  

And… she burned her hands **saving me.**"  

The two men walked in silence.  

They stopped at a **crucifix** standing in the garden.  

"Christ was nailed to a **cross.**  

Some believers claim their faith is so deep  
that **stigmas** appear on their hands.  

Of course, an old sinner like me **will never have them.**"  

Gerald stared at the **cross.**  

The Pope **placed a hand on his shoulder.**  

"Sometimes,  
**a mark is enough to perform miracles.**"  

      

# 33. The Impending Danger   
      

**December 15, 1315 – Habsburg Palace, Aargau**  

"Hah… **There it is.**"  

While his men **held Johan's funeral,**  
Keith **rode ahead, alone,** to Habsburg Palace.  

The moment he arrived, he **rushed into the underground vault.**  

Finally, he held **Cesar's Red GemSTONE** in his hands.  

Leopold I, who had followed Keith into the vault,  
was delighted to see a **Habsburg-born knight**  
returning to his court.  

For a king in a **quiet Swiss outpost,**  
nothing brought more **prestige**  
than hosting a **representative of the empire.**  

"So… you're certain Cesar **died in the duel?**"  

Leopold asked,  
wanting confirmation.  

Keith scowled,  
glancing over his shoulder.  

"Ugh… That's not what I meant.  
It's just that Cesar was no **ordinary man.**"  

"His **arrogance** killed him.  
He was brilliant, but overconfident."  

"Then that means his **GemSTONE now belongs to you, Keith.**"  

**BOOM!**  

With a **deafening crash,**  
the vault door **exploded inward.**  

Cesar stormed in.  

Steam hissed from his **mechanical arm.**  

"You **dare** claim **my GemSTONE** as your own?"  

Cesar's **glowing red eyes**  
locked onto Keith and Leopold.  

"The **power of the Red GemSTONE**  
can only be wielded **by me.**  

Have you forgotten that, **Keith?**"  

Keith and Leopold **froze.**  

Their **teeth chattered**  
as they trembled in disbelief.  

"T-This can't be…  
You were **killed by Gerald's sword!**"  

Keith glanced around,  
his **cold gaze** scanning the vault.  

"If you're even **thinking**  
about trying to kill me again,  
don't bother.  

**A man who cannot die…  
is not worth fighting.**"  

Cesar **strode forward**  
and **wrapped his metal hand** around Keith's throat.  

"I'll give you **one last chance.**  

From now on,  
**I command the Templar Order.**  

You will **follow my orders.**"  

"You dare, Cesar!?"  

Leopold **shouted.**  

"Keith is a **noble of the Habsburg family!**"  

Despite his terror,  
he tried to **maintain his royal authority.**  

"Hah…  

You still think  
I'm just a **pawn of Habsburg?**  

**How foolish.**"  

"You **bastard!**  
You dare speak to me like—!"  

Leopold lunged forward.  

But his **body stopped midair.**  

"Ugh…!"  

Leopold flailed,  
his limbs **suspended in the air.**  

His **face twisted in horror.**  

**Sssssshhh…**  

Steam hissed from Cesar's **metallic arm.**  

![33](/01_gemston/images/33_cesar_kill_leofold.webp)
      

He **extended his mechanical fingers,**  
and **red energy** crackled in his palm.  

As he **slowly curled his fingers,**  
Leopold's **face contorted in agony.**  

Cesar smirked.  

Then, he **clenched his fist.**  

**SPLAT.**  

Leopold's **body exploded.**  

Blood and flesh  
splattered across the vault.  

Keith **collapsed, shaking violently.**  

A **wet stain** spread down his leg.  

"Fascinating…"  

Cesar mused.  

"Each time I **die and return,**  
I gain even **greater control** over the GemSTONE.  

Perhaps…  
**death is a gift.** Hahaha!"  

Cesar **swept his crimson cloak**  
over his **now fully mechanical left arm and leg.**  

His **glowing red eyes** locked onto Keith.  

"Listen carefully, Keith.  

Maria's hands are **ruined.**  

Now is our chance  
to **seize all her GemSTONEs.**  

Summon the **entire Templar Order**  
to Habsburg Palace.  

Forget the **Swiss rebellion.**  

The **GemSTONEs are all that matter.**"  

Keith **nodded weakly,**  
his body still trembling.  

.  
.  
.  

**January 10, 1316 – Habsburg Palace, Aargau**  

Following Cesar's **orders,**  
Keith gathered **2,000 Templar knights**  
at Habsburg Palace.  

Under normal circumstances,  
this would be an **extremely dangerous situation.**  

A force of **2,000 elite warriors**  
could **easily destroy** a fortress like Habsburg Palace  
if they chose to rebel.  

But Cesar held **absolute power.**  

Not only did he have **the Red GemSTONE,**  
but he had also promised the knights  
something **even stronger—**  

**Greed.**  

From afar, Cesar watched  
as **his knights assembled.**  

At the foot of the palace,  
**a long line of wagons** awaited.  

Inside the wagons were  
**piles of stolen GemSTONEs.**  

By evening,  
the 2,000 knights stood **before the palace gates.**  

Cesar **leapt onto one of the wagons,**  
standing **above the glowing Red GemSTONEs.**  

His **crimson cloak billowed** in the wind.  

"Today,"  

his voice rang,  
enhanced by a **strange mechanical undertone.**  

"We stand **on the edge of history!**"  

All **2,000 knights**  
listened in rapt attention.  

"The **Pope of Avignon**  
has declared us **excommunicated.**  

Then let us **give him death!**"  

"DEATH TO AVIGNON!"  

The knights **raised their swords and spears,**  
shouting in **fierce agreement.**  

The **Aargau sunset** burned **a deep red,**  
casting an **ominous glow**  
over the battlefield.  

Standing atop the **pile of GemSTONEs,**  
Cesar spread his arms.  

"Seize **the Pope's GemSTONEs!**  

With their power,  

**we will rule the empire!**"  

"HUZZAH!!!"  

With an **explosive leap,**  
Cesar **soared through the air,**  
landing atop the **northern wall** of Habsburg Palace.  

The knights watched in **awe.**  

At first,  
they had **feared his power.**  

Now, they **worshipped it.**  

Cesar **raised his left hand,**  
his mechanical fingers curling.  

A **mass of red energy** formed in his palm,  
swirling into a **blazing sphere.**  

Then—  

**he unleashed it.**  

A pillar of **fire**  
**erupted from his hand,**  
shooting **across the plains**  
toward a **distant village.**  

The firestorm **carved a straight line**  
for **several kilometers,**  
incinerating everything in its path.  

"Do you **believe** in the power of the GemSTONE?"  

Cesar's **roar** shook the battlefield.  

"CESAR! CESAR! CESAR!"  

The knights **erupted in cheers,**  
chanting his name.  

"Attach **your GemSTONEs**  
to your weapons!  

I will **infuse them** with power!  

Once we **conquer the empire,**  
you will all be **rewarded with gold and land!**"  

That night,  
the **banquet** lasted deep into the evening.  

Thousands of knights **drank and feasted,**  
their hearts burning with **greed and ambition.**  

"Yes…  
No more fighting for someone else.  
**Now, we take power for ourselves!** Hahaha!"  

Late into the night,  
Cesar sat alone, **silently plotting.**  

After much thought,  
he decided to **invade Avignon in the spring.**  

For the next **month,**  
he would **train his knights,**  
teaching them how to **harness**  
the power of the **Red GemSTONE.**  

"The Pope of Avignon…"  

Cesar chuckled to himself.  

"…will soon **taste the fires of Hell.**"
